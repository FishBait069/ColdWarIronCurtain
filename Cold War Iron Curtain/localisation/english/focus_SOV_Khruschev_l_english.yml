 Tblisi.1.d:0 "Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinization would begin to tear down the cult of personality formed around the totalitarian during his lifetime, but not all would approve. Many have come to see Stalin as a national hero who bravely led the Communist world against the evils of the Axis powers and the Imperial oppressors. Stalin remains especially popular in his home region of Georgia, where Khrushchev has grown increasingly unpopular due to his anti-Stalin reforms. Khrushchev's closed door speech to the 20th Congress which rallied against Stalin and his Georgian loyalists would only further cause frustration. In retaliation, on March 4th, Georgians would gather around a monument of Stalin to mourn the third anniversary of his death. Within the coming days, an organized protest movement against Khrushchev would begin to gain major traction as thousands of people took to the street. Quickly, the situation has devolved with many Georgian nationalists calling for the secession of Georgia from the Soviet Union entirely. Georgian local authorities are entirely blindsided and wait for instructions from Moscow. " 							#The Tbilisi Riot (over removal of Stalin monument)
 destalinization.3.d:0 "After nearly 6 days of paralyzing riots in the Georgian SSR, Moscow has finally reasserted full control over her region. Following an intense standoff against local police forces, the military was sent in to disperse the crowds.  The situation would meet its head when a civilian delegation would be arrested by the government and the protesters would storm the military and police to rescue them. Soviet tanks would storm into Lenin Square Follower by troop battalions which would have no qualms in gunning the crowd down with live ammunition. By the 10th of March, protesters were arrested and killed in mass with hundreds others disappearing within the middle of the night. Order has been restored but the legitimacy of Khrushchev and his leadership are now questionable." 					#Restore Public Order (Aftermath of Tbilisi Riot)
 malenkov_resign.1.d:0 "Following the death of Lavrentiy Beria, pressure would quickly amount on Premier George Malenkov to step down. Khrushchev and the rest of the Politburo were quick to denounce Malenkov for his close connection to Beria and his willingness to betray others for political gain. Without much of a choice in the matter, he would announce his resignation in February of 1955. Following this, he would return as a regular member on the Politburo disgruntled. With this, new leadership of the Soviet Union can finally begin." 					#Malenkov Resignation

 Beria_Arriest.1.d:0 "Head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria, once seemed to be in a position to take the reigns of the Soviet Union following the death of Stalin. However, his scheming would fall short as his rivals were one step ahead. During a meeting with his close advisors, military forces would circumvent the NKVD and arrest Beria and his collaborators. Quickly after, a makeshift trial absent of a defense counsel would find Beria guilty of treasonous actions in coordination with London and terrorism against the state. Beria and six of his cohorts were quickly put to a firing squad with their remains burned. With one of the darkest figures of the Stalin era put to rest, what awaits the future of the Soviet Union remains undecided as many figures still hold great sway over the Politburo."
