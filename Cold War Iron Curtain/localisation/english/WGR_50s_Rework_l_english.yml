 WGR_found_the_gsg9_desc:0 "As a consequence of the mismanagement of the 1972 Olympic tragedy, the West German government created the GSG 9 under the leadership of then Oberstleutnant Ulrich Wegener so that similar situations in the future could be responded to adequately and professionally. Many German politicians oppose its formation, fearing GSG 9 would rekindle memories of the Nazi Party's Schutzstaffel (SS). The decision was taken to form the unit from police forces, as opposed to from the military, like the equivalent forces in other countries, on the ground that German federal law expressly forbids the use of the military forces against the civilian population."
 WGR_Establish_the_Ministry_of_Health:0 "Establish the Ministry of Health"
 WGR_Establish_the_Ministry_of_Health_desc:0 "With the economy skyrocketing during the Wirtschaftswunder, Germany quickly transformed into a welfare state. This offered her citizens easy access to various supportive measures should they ever experience dire times. A major element of this concept is the healthcare system and its mandatory health insurance for workers and officials. By now, it has become an ever-growing task to organize and maintain such a bureaucratic juggernaut. Consequentially, the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (Federal Ministry of Health) shall be established under the purview of our Minister of Health. It is tasked with guaranteeing the stability and high quality of our healthcare system while also reining in the numerous health insurance companies."

 WGR_Bundeswehr_desc:0 "After the destruction and dissolution of the Nazi Wehrmacht, the German nation had been without an army for almost a decade. In 1955, the foundations were laid for the Bundeswehr, the new army for a new Germany. Since then, we have come a long way to equip our forces with modern weapons, create an efficient administration and implement new tactics. At the dawn of the 60’s, rising international tensions and ever so advancing technology demand further modernizations, improved organizational structures and most importantly further expansion of the Bundeswehr. „Wir. Dienen. Deutschland!“"

 WGR_Expand_the_Autobahn_desc:0 "Created during the times of the Weimarer Republik when cars saw increasing use by civilians, then expanded by Hitler to ensure jobs and later improved war infrastructure, the famous highways of Germany have become an international example for efficient transportation and fast travel. So far, we have invested a lot of money and effort to rebuild and expand the road system, but there sure is potential for even more improvement! Let us connect the North with the South, every industrial center, every city, and every village with streets to behold! Our citizens and manufacturers will be grateful!"
 WGR_Expand_North_German_Infrastructure:0 "Expand North German Infrastructure"
 WGR_Expand_North_German_Infrastructure_desc:0 "The revival of Germany’s industrial heartland in Nordrhein-Westfalen was an utter success. At steady pace, new factories are built, companies founded, and workplaces created. While this development is most welcoming, our economy will only continue growing when produced goods can be efficiently transported to purchasers. While national distribution of consumer goods is important, quick access to the export and import hotspots in the ports of Hamburg or Bremen are just as crucial for keeping up with international competition and keeping our own industry supplied with foreign materials. It is therefore in our best interest to further improve the infrastructure in the North."
 WGR_Haindl_Papier_GmbH:0 "Haindl Paper Corporation"
 WGR_Haindl_Papier_GmbH_desc:0 "Originally founded during the mid-19th century in Augsburg, the Haindl Papier GmbH opened a paper factory in the city of Walsum in the year 1962. Caused by a market niche at that time and the massive production capacity of the new site, the company soon turned into the number one paper producer within Germany."
 WGR_Expand_the_Ritterstrasse:0 "Expand the Ritterstrasse"
 WGR_Expand_the_Ritterstrasse_desc:0 "Hamburg, Cologne, Munich, Nuremberg... the large cities of yore have been transformed from ruins to buzzling population centers once more. These days, the sight of rarely any buildings triggers the memories of the disastrous destruction mere fifteen years ago. But in this new age of technology, our architects should go above and beyond themselves and not only recreate the former cityscape but modernize it! An excellent example for such efforts is the recently inaugurated metro stop Ritterstrasse in Hamburg. With the continuously growing metro system of our largest city, the masses can travel to and depart from this commercial arcade with ease, providing the stores and shops with waves of new costumers. And, of course, the government with additional tax income."
 WGR_North_German_Port_Expansions:0 "North German Port Expansions"
 WGR_North_German_Port_Expansions_desc:0 "The harbors of northern Germany have always been her door to the world. Starting in the 14th century with the “Hanse”, a trading cooperation between the large port cities of Hamburg, Bremen, Rostock and Lübeck, these towns have experienced a massive increase in economic and political power over centuries within the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire. During World War II, their commercial role and strategic importance as the birthplaces of the Kriegsmarine brought massive destruction with it. Our recent reconstruction efforts saw the revival of piers and docks, but the continued economic growth, combined with an increased need for export and import capacity, demands a second expansion of our ports in Hamburg, Bremen, and Kiel. Let the world know that we are back on the global economic stage!"

Even with the Iron Curtain at our doorstep, we have daily contact with our numerous European neighbors in the West, our allies in the NATO and business contacts around the globe. It comes to no surprise that at some point, an institute was created to conduct research for international cooperation, economy, and development. The Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungshilfe (DIE) is an extracurricular establishment which will dive into these specific fields of science to intensify global cooperation, support our interests abroad and educate future administration staff."
 WGR_Water_Infrastructure_Investments:0 "Water Infrastructure Investments"
 WGR_Water_Infrastructure_Investments_desc:0 "Water is essential for life as we know it. If water supplies stopped at any moment, it would cause a humanitarian crisis in no time. Aside our citizens, the industry is also to be provided with fresh, clean running water. Production often involves water cooling, or the liquid itself as a base for other goods. And let us not forget about agriculture…well, the list goes on. For a fact, it is an imperative that a reliable, hygienic, and durable water infrastructure exists in Germany, reaching to even the most rural areas. While we do have such system already, there is still room for major improvements. What kind of industrial nation in the first world would we be without universal access to clean water?"
 WGR_Hannover_Medical_School:0 "Hannover Medical School"
 WGR_Hannover_Medical_School_desc:0 "With the continued expansion of our Healthcare System, we are in dire need of new medical staff. Although a new medical university in Hannover should provide more than enough capacity for the near future, founding director Professor Rudolf Schoen demands a reformed medical curriculum. One major change in young doctors’ education will be “learning next to the patients’ bed”, as he put it. In other words, Prof. Schoen suggests a stronger emphasis on practical and social skills contrary to the almost exclusively theoretic approach of the past. This will result in a better quality of treatment, and a closer bond between the gods in white and their patients."
 WGR_Tertiary_Sector_in_West_Berlin:0 "Tertiary Sector in West Berlin"
 WGR_Tertiary_Sector_in_West_Berlin_desc:0 "In the 19th century, the German industry was a late starter compared to the United Kingdom and France but caught up soon after and resulted in an impressive secondary sector, famed around the globe. With the Marshal Plan and the Wirtschaftswunder, this important mainstay of our economy has returned once more. Although in the case of West Berlin, the isolated and besieged city state has a major problem: Factories need to be supplied with material, which is hard to come by when surrounded by closed borders. Consequentially the newest economic sector of our modern times has found its way to the old capital: The tertiary sector. Offices for information, marketing and communication are founded in record time. Those do not need many resources, but masses of willing white-collar workers and a few managers." 
 WGR_Establish_Nature_Parks:0 "Establish Nature Parks"
 WGR_Establish_Nature_Parks_desc:0 "The rapid industrialization in the 19th century and continued growth during the first half of the 20th century did not pass without leaving deep scars on nature. Forests were cut down to create additional area for agriculture, wetlands were dried up for new settlements, rivers channeled for better shipping routes and so on. What little remains of truly untouched nature in Germany is threatened by pollution, tourists, and further exploitation. Suggested by various groups and initiatives for some time now, nature parks shall be established to properly protect various ecosystems which present unique compositions, qualities, or species. Not only do we owe that to mother nature and the national heritage; our citizens will be thankful for preserving the beauty of nature for them and future generations to enjoy!"

 WGR_Roland_Berger_Strategy_Consultants_desc:0 "After working for the Boston Consulting Group in the U.S. from 1962 to 1967, Mister Roland Berger started his own consultation office in Munich in 1967. In the States, he learned about new business strategies and imported this knowledge to Germany where Berger’s fresh ideas were met with fascination. Soon, a major assignment by the large travel agency Touropa presented the golden opportunity for his office to enter the international stage. Over the years, the focus changed from Marketing (selling products and services) to Strategy (achieving business goals). These days, it is one of the largest consultant agencies worldwide."

When the left terror group RAF (Red Army Faction) was shattered and their leaders trialed, all of them were imprisoned in the most heavily guarded tract of this facility.

Originally planned as a medical university, the concept was soon expanded to a combined focus on medicine and natural sciences. Over the years, the institution emphasized on modern research topics like gerontology, trauma treatment, quantum technologies and human-machine interaction."

 WGR_WDR_3_Public_Radio_desc:0 "The radio, next to newspapers, has been the most important medium for a long time. Although the advent of television is changing the information market, almost every German household and car is equipped with a radio. With such a large audience, the government eagerly established a public service broadcast branch in the ether: The Westdeutscher Rundfunk 3 (West German Broadcast 3). Inspired by the third radio programme of the BBC, the third programme of the WDR is aimed towards the more sophisticated listener.

What was dubbed the Republikflucht is the reaction to low living standards, economic instability, and repression in the East. To counter this increasingly problematic trend, a simple yet crude solution was realized on August 13th, 1961, by the regime in East Berlin. A wall was built to separate West Germany from East Germany, while West Berlin was completely walled in, isolated in the red sphere. The official reason for this action was stated as “protection from fascist influence”, but obviously presented the DDR’s desperate attempt to prevent mass emigration. The reaction of our allies to this division was so far disappointing, merely consisting of pro forma reprehension. But our party shall shout out loudly what every German thinks of this atrocious affront!"

This action resulted in a political scandal for the sitting party CDU and was heavily condemned by various groups and students. After much turmoil, including the protest resignation of five ministers, the Minister of Defense Franz Josef Strauß (CDU) abdicated, two state secretaries in charge of the prosecution were fired, the arrested journalists were freed, and Chancellor Adenauer had to form a new cabinet. This resulted in a decisive political power loss for the CDU and was praised as a major victory for the freedom of press."

Although mostly successful, Adenauer also dropped a few bricks for being a rather pigheaded fellow. Being the most noteworthy, the infamous Spiegel Affair was the catalyst for his resignation on October 15th, 1963. In addition, his advanced age of 87 years also called for temperance. One day after the formal abdication, the former Minister of Economy and father of the Wirtschaftswunder Ludwig Erhard was nominated as Adenauer’s successor."

Founded on its design, Herr Vorgrimler created a new, modern type of automatic rifle called AR58 for the Spanish troops. The Bundeswehr ordered a batch of those in the early 60s but modified it to their demanding standards.

To supply the Bundeswehr with tanks and continue our tradition of efficient design, the company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann was tasked to develop the first indigenous tank since the end of the war.

 ####Events 1950s#####
 
 
 WGRElection.1.d:0 "The first West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Kurt Schumacher have the majority of the votes. A minority party still able to wield some influence is the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) rumored to have Soviet assistance. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.2.d:0 "The second West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.3.d:0 "The third West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.4.d:0 "After the five-year long military government, Germany is ready once more for a provisional election. With the fracturing of the SPD, the two competing parties are now the Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the German Party and Free Democratic Party coalition led by Heinrich Hellwege and Franz Blucher. Who will win?"
 
 Starting.1.d:0 "May 23, 1949 will be a momentous day for German history forever! Today, the work of the Parliamentary Council has come to reality as the Grundgesetz was signed and promulgated. Composed of members of West German state parliaments, the Council drafted the document and approved it, 53 votes to 12, on May 8. It was then put forth to state parliaments, being finally approved by all except the Bavarian Lander. This document, including the formation of the German federal government and providing crucial rights to all its citizens, marks the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany."
 Starting.2.d:0 "“(1) The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state.\n(2) All state authority emanates from the people. It shall be exercised by the people in elections and plebiscites and by means of separate legislative, executive, and judicial organs.\n(3) Legislation shall be limited by the constitution, the executive and the administration of justice by legislation and the law.”\n\nArticle 20 is one of the fundamental articles of the Basic Law, describing the governmental structure of the Federal Republic and guarantees democracy, republicanism, social responsibility and federalism, being more direct than the past Weimar Constitution. As well, Article 20 has the privilege of not being able to be removed from the Basic Law as it guarantees democracy for all."
 Starting.3.d:0 "“For the time being, this Basic Law shall apply in the territory of the Laender Baden, Bavaria, Bremen, Greater Berlin, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. It shall be put into force for other parts of Germany on their accession.”\n\nArticle 23 focuses on the German Lander, or states. The Lander have always had a large part in German unitary government, and this article provides other de jure German states, not included in the field of application of the Basic Law, to declare their accession, or Beitritt, at a later date. This is designed to give the Lander a fair opportunity to join the Federal Republic, assuming they are recognized by the federal government and declared their accession via free self-determination. This truly is a watershed moment for relations between the federal government and the Lander in German politics."
 
 Adenauer49.1.d:0 "The debate on the new capital for the Federal Republic is raging in the new Bundestag. Currently, the capital is located in the western city of Bonn, on the banks of the Rhine River. However, members of the SPD have argued for a relocation of the capital to the city of Frankfurt, arguing that the city already has the required facilities and that it would be 95 million marks cheaper. However, CDU members are pushing back, arguing that Bonn is the provisional capital and the capital should not be moved until all of Germany is reunited. Where shall the capital be?"
 Adenauer49.2.d:0 "“I am afraid that the Western Allies, instead of pursuing a European policy, are getting into a policy of interest which tends rather to prop up an authoritarian Adenauer regime than to allow it to be replaced by a democratic regime… What we have to debate and to vote on today is nothing but a test of whether the Basic Law is a scrap of paper and whether the majority can continue in its endeavors to ride roughshod over it…”\n\nThis brought applause from the SPD side, and interjections and boos from the CDU side of the Bundestag chamber. Herr Doktor Arndt of the SPD continued to speak.\n\n“We thought we were on the way to a parliamentary democracy and find ourselves on the way to a monarchy without a constitution... Herr Chancellor, we shall not let you forget this oath!”\n\nChancellor Adenauer rose to speak, noting that the trade unions of Germany were behind the government in their earnest desire to sign the Petersberg Agreement, even though it addressed dismantlement of industries. This prompted questions from the SPD opposition, questioning the validity of the claim. This debate continued to rage on, but a decision must be made, quickly."
 Adenauer49.3.d:0 "On 29 December 1948, the three Western Allies as well as the three Benelux countries issued the Ruhr Statute, a special system of ordering the workings of the Ruhr industry. The Ruhr Authority envisaged by the Statute, a body consisting of representatives of the six powers, was established on 28 April 1949, including provision for representatives of the Federal Republic as members of the Authority.\n\nThis prompted a clash of opinions between the Government and, above all, the Social Democratic opposition on a question closely connected with the problem of dismantling, namely that of recognizing the Ruhr Authority by sending a German representative. In practice the function of this Authority would amount to control of the entire German economy because of the overwhelming importance of the industrial area of the Ruhr for all economic life in Germany.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting, Chancellor Adenauer explained that participation in the Statute would have favorable consequences; if we refused, it would amount to obstruction, and therefore, a thaw in Allied relations.\n\nHowever, the other argument was that domestically, membership would not be popular and Government support would stumble, especially in Landtag elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. Which way shall Germany go?"
 Adenauer49.4.d:0 "To commemorate the new decade of the 1950s, Chancellor Adenauer addressed the collected Bundestag chamber, as well as high-ranking government officials in a New Year’s Address. Beginning after applause, mostly from the CDU side of the chamber, he began.\n\n “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Bundestag, Cabinet Ministers, foreign dignitaries and all those present, we are entering a new age. Less than a year ago, the Federal Republic was founded, and as we enter the 1950s, Germany will only grow more and more. Our relationships with the Western Powers only grow, while we pursue unification of Germany into one democratic state, not one controlled by one political party. As we enter a new age of technological development, Germany will be on the leading edge of this innovation, as we consolidate our limited industrial use for good. As I stand here, a testament to European democracy and peace is shown, and this shall continue forevermore!”"
 Adenauer49.5.d:0 "The reactions to German rearmament proposals by the Allies have been mixed within the Federal Republic’s government. The SPD’s position on German participation in a European defense community has been indeed hostile, with Dr. Schumacher considering CDU offers for rearmament to be premature, and is afraid that the Americans would make an offer that they could not keep. However, the CDU argues that the Soviet threat is large enough to warrant a rapid German rearmament, and that if they did not align with the Allies, the Federal Republic could be swept into the Soviet bloc, and would lose our sovereignty."
 Adenauer49.6.d:0 "Today is a momentous day in the Federal Republic’s history as the steelworks in the city of Salzgitter, known as the Salzgitter Works, were dismantled by German workers and observed by representatives from the three Allied powers. Formerly under the umbrella of Reichswerke Hermann Goering, the works helped to fuel the German war machine, especially in the production of panzer tanks, planes and weapons. After Allied capture, the works sat unused for years, until now. This is a major loss of German industry, but needed to remove a symbol of Nazi industry and dominance."
 Adenauer49.7.d:0 "Today, the German Government is proud to announce the official end of food rationing within the Federal Republic. Since the end of World War II, a rationing plan was put into place concerning all matters of consumables, including coal, eggs, meat, oil and potatoes. The Allies helped to supplement this, but we have finally reached the point where it is beneficial to stop rationing as we have an ample supply of food and other consumables."
 Adenauer49.8.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag yet another debate raged, this time about the Federal Republic’s possible accession to the Council of Europe. The CDU started, with Chancellor Adenauer speaking on the reasons why the Federal Republic should join; the willingness of other European governments to include Germany, especially the willingness of the French government and Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, and the benefits of entering into a union with other European democracies.\n\nThe SPD speakers countered, asking why the CDU insisted on this and urging delay until they could determine the real reasons why. The debate goes on, but we must make a decision soon."
 Adenauer49.9.d:0 "Today Chancellor Adenauer made a public announcement on all radio and television networks announcing a new decree. A resolution recently passed by the federal government concerning the constitutional loyalty of civil servants will go into effect; therefore, members of banned organizations cannot work in the federal government. Specifying that “persons in the service of the federal government must commit themselves to the democratic conception of the state through their entire conduct” and is directed towards 11 leftist organizations and 2 National Socialist organizations, including the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the Free German Youth (FDJ), the Kulturbund and the Association of Victims of the Nazi Regime (VVN). Criticism for being authoritarian is bound to come soon, but this is needed for democracy."
 Adenauer49.10.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from the Federal Chancellery. An undersecretary to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Hans Globke, has been implicated in past Nazi actions, including having been responsible for drafting the Enabling Act of 1933 which allowed Hitler to have dictatorial powers; as well as several of the Nuremburg Race Laws targeting Jews. Globke was never a member of the Nazi Party, but was intimately involved with anti-Semitic efforts. After the war, Globke was exonerated of any wrongdoing and served as a witness at the 1948 Ministries Trial, then being appointed by Adenauer in 1949. The Chancellor has decided not to fire him, out of respect, but is prepared to face immense criticism for Globke’s past."
 Adenauer49.11.d:0 "A new report landed on Chancellor Adenauer’s desk today. Titled the “Himmerod Memorandum” after its drafting location of Himmerod Abbey, it lays the foundation for the establishment of a new German military force, called the Bundeswehr. Key demands included the release of all German soldiers convicted as war criminals, the cessation of defamation of German soldiers, and measures to transform domestic and foreign public opinion of the German military. The group of German officers who drafted it, including Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger, hope that the Chancellor will accept their memorandum and begin discussions with the three Western powers to satisfy their requests."
 Adenauer49.12.d:0 "Landsberg Prison is an infamous penal facility in Bavaria, best known as the prison where Adolf Hitler was held after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, and where Mein Kampf was written. Used by the American powers during the occupation for holding war criminals, it was renamed to War Criminal Prison Nr. 1 in 1946. Over the time of its existence, Landsberg was used for nearly 300 executions of condemned war criminals. Now, it is still used to house war criminals but is under our jurisdiction. On one hand, the time is nigh to release them; the death penalty is abolished in the Federal Republic, but on the other hand, keeping them imprisoned will set an example to those seeking undemocratic forms of government. What shall we do?"
 Adenauer49.13.d:0 "Today the Chancellor’s plane from Germany landed in London, and with great fanfare, Chancellor Adenauer met Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time since a German head of government had touched British soil in 20 years. Remarking on common Anglo-German goals; the preservation of peace and the defense of the democratic order, Adenauer gave an assurance that Germany would prove itself a steadfast ally. Dissuading fears of German economic competition and renewed nationalist movements, Adenauer stressed the importance of Germany in the question of Europe and defense of democracy. This truly was a success for German foreign relations and Anglo-German relations!"  
 Adenauer49.14.d:0 "Interesting proposals have been received by the three Western Allies and the Federal Chancellery. Apparently, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin has put forth proposals for German reunification, assuming that we are neutral and guarantee “the rights of man and basic freedoms”. Allied officials are suspicious that the “Stalin Notes” are simply a bluff for the Soviets to blame the Allies for a divided Germany. Chancellor Adenauer and the CDU characterize the notes as an aggressive action that attempts to stall the reintegration of West Germany into European politics, and even the SPD considers this a possibility. It seems clear that the government is united behind this, but a decision needs to be made, and soon."
 Adenauer49.15.d:0 "German-European integration continues today with the signing of the Bonn-Paris Conventions in Bonn between the three Western Allies and the Federal Republic. Important provisions include Article 1, which accords the Federal Republic “the full authority as a sovereign State over its internal and external affairs”, and Article 2, which provides that the Three Powers retain their rights concerning Berlin and all of Germany, including reunification and a peace settlement. This is a huge step for German sovereignty and European integration, and is only the first step in a long, long journey."
 Adenauer53.1.d:0 "With a victory in the 1953 election, Konrad Adenauer has retained his position as Chancellor of the Federal Republic. Beginning his second government with largely the same cabinet as before, Adenauer has announced his intention to hand off the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a subordinate minister, at a date to be announced later. Additionally, it is expected that Theodor Heuss, current Federal President, is expected to remain in his position without much opposition. Political analysts domestically and abroad consider Adenauer’s continued leadership to be a benefit for West Germany and are expecting a continuation of greater economic and social rebuilding in the country."
 Adenauer53.2.d:0 "Nations around the world, particularly the three Western Allies, are outraged at talk of the release of the “Spandau Seven”; a group of Nazi war criminals interred in the Spandau Prison in Western Berlin including Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, and Rudolf Hess. After internal discussions in the Chancellery concerning the possible release of Konstantin von Neurath, former Foreign Minister of Germany and Erich Raeder, former Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine from Spandau, the Western Allies have largely condemned this action, but have not committed to any concrete action against it for the stability of the country."
 Adenauer53.3.d:0 "Celebrations abound in the Federal Republic today with the victory of the German national football team against the Hungarian “Golden Team” or “Mighty Magyars” in the final of the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Played at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland, the Hungarian team was favored to win but was defeated. Considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history, and known as the “Miracle of Bern”, this victory has allowed a sense of regained international recognition and popularity of the Federal Republic on the world stage, attempting to fix its public perception after the Second World War and denazification."
 Adenauer53.4.d:0 "Events recently of top-level officials in the German Government have come as a shock to both those at home and abroad. Otto John, the President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution; the Federal Republic’s domestic intelligence agency, disappeared in Berlin several days ago after attending a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the July 20th plot against Hitler. Three days later, John appeared in communist East Berlin, disavowing his former country and criticizing Chancellor Adenauer’s policies of Western integration and remilitarization.\n\nThe German government has expressed outrage at this incident and are demanding his arrest and extradition from East Germany to our custody."
 Adenauer53.5.d:0 "A new foreign policy has been announced today at the Federal Chancellery. Named after State Secretary at the Foreign Office Walter Hallstein, the Hallstein Doctrine prescribes that the Federal Republic will not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognized the German Democratic Republic, the illegal communist counterpart to our east. Based on the Soviet recognition of the GDR in March 1954, and our own recent agreements with the Soviets this year, we have the exclusive mandate to make this declaration based on the government’s right to represent the whole of Germany. This will for sure determine our future foreign policy, our outlook and standing on the world stage."
 Adenauer53.6.d:0 "Chancellor Adenauer returned from Moscow today, finishing a visit to the lion’s den for the West German government, and principally focusing on the return of the last German prisoners of war, a decade after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nTouching down in Moscow, Adenauer saw himself as an equal partner to the Russians, posing for a photo op with Soviet representative Nikolai Bulganin and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. However, negotiations stalled and threatened to dissolve, until the German and Soviet delegations attended a show of “Romeo and Juliet” at the Bolshoi Theater.\n\nTowards the end of the play, when the fathers embraced each other over the bodies of Romeo and Juliet, Adenauer and Bulganin stood up and embraced similarly, marking a poignant moment in the visit.\n\nSubsequent discussions proved fruitful, and agreements were reached; diplomatic relations with the Soviets, for the release of 10,000 POWs. Known as the “Homecoming of the Ten Thousand”, this success will forever be remembered in Germany, and beyond."
 Adenauer53.7.d:0 "It is official! With the ratification of the Paris Agreement on February 27, 1955, the Federal Republic of Germany is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western European mutual security alliance founded by the three Western Allies and nine other countries in 1949. After having signed the NATO troop statute and other agreements establishing the end of the occupation regime, a ceremony was held in Paris celebrating the Federal Republic’s accession, and maneuvers with NATO forces and the Bundeswehr are expected to begin next year. This addition to the alliance is guaranteed to anger the Soviets and set the line of conflict at the inner-German border, entering into a new age in this Cold War."
 Adenauer53.8.d:0 "Today was no normal meeting of the Chancellor’s Cabinet. A situation had developed in the Middle East, and Chancellor Adenauer felt that it warranted a response.\n\nAdenauer opened. “Herr Brentano, what does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs know?”\n\n“Mr. Chancellor, as you know, Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal on July 26. It’s been just over three months now, and we have been informed that those two countries have deployed paratroopers to seize the Suez Canal.”\n\nThis prompted a flurry of conversation from around the cabinet table.\n\nAdenauer spoke above them. “We must make a decision; whether to honor our friendship with Britain and France; or to speak out in support of Nasser, offering diplomatic support.”\n\nBrentano spoke again. “Going against the Allies, especially the French, may not be wise right now. We are still trying to consolidate our position on the world stage. However, pledging support for the United Nations effort currently may prove as a neutral position; supporting Nasser by default, without directly intervening.”\n\nAdenauer considered the options, then placed the matter up to a vote of the Cabinet. What will our position be?"
 Adenauer53.9.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag an important issue was being debated, one that could change the borders of the Federal Republic; the issue of the Saarland.\n\nFrom 1947 onwards, the Saarland was detached from the French occupation zone and enjoyed political autonomy as well as an economic community with France, but was still under the control of a French High Commissioner. The German government under Chancellor Adenauer has continued its efforts to end the special status of the Saar and annex it into the Federal Republic as a Lander. While some people in the Saar protest that they should be sovereign, the majority of the country considers the Saar to be a part of Germany, an important economic component, and a way to wrest control of the area from France. What shall they decide?"
 Adenauer53.10.d:0 "The tension in the air was thick as senior officers of the new German Bundeswehr entered the smoke-filled chambers of the NATO Military Committee session. They approached the table and sat, facing representatives from the other fourteen NATO members.\n\nThe chairman began. “Today we begin the first day of discussions concerning the deployment of NATO nuclear weapons on territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. We welcome our colleagues from the Bundeswehr to share their input.” There was general clapping and nods of approval all around, as some members continued to smoke intermittently.\n\nThe most senior Bundeswehr officer began to speak. “If I may be so bold, I’d like to thank the members of this committee for allowing us to speak today. However, I feel that the Bundeswehr, and the government of the Federal Republic at large, has concerns about the deployment of nuclear weapons on our territory. We are on the front-lines, the battleground-”\n\nThe American representative interrupted. “Exactly! Now that the Federal Republic has joined NATO, we should turn our attention to placing more nuclear weapons on German soil, thereby extending our range and making it easier to strike the Soviets should that be needed.”\n\nThe senior Bundeswehr officer looked visibly angry. “You see, that’s the problem. We are a new country, with a small and new military. If nuclear weapons are placed on our territory, it presents a threat to the Soviet Union and gives them even more of a reason to attack!”\n\nThe American delegate shot back. “But you see, Article 5 guarantees your security now. The filthy commies wouldn’t dare to attack us!” He was silently shushed by the committee chairman, who looked like he needed a stiff drink. “Perhaps we should deliberate on this issue in closed session.”"
 Adenauer53.11.d:0 "Today in Rome, the Federal Republic participated in signing the Treaty of Rome, also called the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and proposed the reduction of customs duties and establishment of a customs union, as well as the creation of a single economic market. More importantly, this treaty established the European Commission, what would be the executive branch of the European Union. Signed by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and State Secretary of the Foreign Office Walter Hallstein, Germany’s participation in this organization will certainly be a benefit to all!"
 Adenauer53.12.d:0 "An important ruling has come down from on high, the Federal Constitutional Court, the supreme court of the land. In determining the legal status of West Berlin, continuing to be occupied by the three Western Allies; the Court has determined that the city is a state of the Federal Republic. Determining the city as an individual Lander provides its citizens rights under the Basic Law. This is an unexpected development, particularly with the three occupying authorities in Berlin; God knows the Soviets will consider this to be a publicity stunt, however."
 Adenauer57.1.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag a major portion of German reform has been passed with the success of the General Consequences of War Act. This act, designed to cover all claims and damages from actions of the former German Reich and transfer them to the Federal Republic, will ultimately prove to be helpful to war reconstruction not just in Germany, but around Europe where damage is done. This is generally recognized as the German government taking complete financial responsibility for the actions of their fascist predecessors and has received broad popular support from the Western Allies."
 Adenauer57.2.d:0 "Today in Ulm the Einsatzkommando, or Einsatzgruppen trial, concluded. Held in front of the Ulm Regional Court, the case surrounded ten members of the Gestapo, Sicherheitdienst, and Ordnungspolizei, who were part of the Tilsit Einsatzkommando during the period of National Socialism. According to a report by Walter Stahlecker, former Commander of Einsatzgruppe A, these ten individuals have been accused of killing over 5,000 Jewish men, women and children near the Lithuanian border during the war.\n\nConsidered the first turning point in the judicial fight against the legacy of National Socialism, all ten defendants were sentenced to between 3 and 15 years in prison for “complimentary murder”, and lost their civil rights for up to 10 years.\n\nThis case has had profound effects, with the founding of the Central Office of the State Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes to help begin the federal prosecution of all cases, allowing the Allies to see that the Federal Republic can police itself."
 Adenauer57.3.d:0 "On July 8, 1954, the Federal Republic of Germany was invited to the World Exhibition in Brussels, also known as Expo 58. Seeming politically sensitive, especially after Nazi Germany’s participation in the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris, this was a watershed moment for the Federal Republic.\n\nThe question of how the Federal Republic should present itself was hotly debated, with controversial debates being held in the Cabinet, until it was finally decided upon in 1956.\n\nThe German pavilion consisted of two stories, covered in glass, with a bridge allowing access over the Bundesautobahn 3. Fairly small compared to the larger US and Soviet pavilions, as well as the more infamous Belgian Congo pavilion, our contribution to Expo 58 represents a hopeful future for the Federal Republic."
 Adenauer57.4.d:0 "A new issue has reared its ugly head in the Bundestag. Ever since the Federal Republic’s accession into NATO and the meeting two years ago in front of the NATO Military Committee, the issue of nuclear weapons has haunted the federal government. Adenauer, and his cabinet, are in favor of NATO deploying nuclear weapons in the Federal Republic, as well as a possible independent nuclear program with France and Italy. However, the SPD has voiced numerous concerns to all aspects, starting with NATO deployment; considering it an overreach and a risk to the safety of not only German citizens, but possible reunification with the East.\n\nAdenauer’s Cabinet, in consultation with SPD members, has proposed a referendum concerning this issue so that the people can decide.\n\nHowever, the issue may be blocked by the Federal Constitutional Court, who has preemptively signaled that allowing nuclear weapons would be unconstitutional under Article 26 of the Basic Law.\n\nShall the referendum go on, reflecting the will of the people, or shall this issue be struck down, once and for all?"
 Adenauer57.5.d:0 "The referendum on nuclear weapons deployment has been held in all of the German federal states, on the order of the German federal government. Millions of eligible Germans lined up in their respective polling locations today, as the nation decided on the fate of NATO nuclear weapons deployment in the Federal Republic. While there has been little comment from NATO Headquarters in Brussels, it is expected that a public statement will follow the announcement of the results. What did the nation choose?"
 Adenauer57.6.d:0 "Yet another cabinet meeting was called today, this time in response to an issue raised by the German embassies in London, Paris, and Washington, concerning a Soviet note sent to the governments of the three latter countries.\n\nAdenauer was already seated, as was the rest of the cabinet, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Heinrich von Brentano, hurried in, hands full with briefing materials and printouts.\n\nAdenauer started. “Brentano, what’s the latest?”\n\nBrentano responded. “Chancellor, the Soviets have indicated…well, rather, demanded… that the Allies pull their troops out of West Berlin, and that the city be a Free City.”\n\nThis prompted a lot of vigorous discussion from the room, which Adenauer spoke over. “Well, I gather that this cabinet does not agree on most of those points, and therefore-”\n\nHe was cut off by a junior minister, the Minister of All-German Affairs. “Sir, maybe this wouldn’t be such a bad idea- Berlin could be free, and the Soviets might back off.” Brentano broke in again. “That’s a terrible idea. We should take a harder line against the Soviets- after all, what did we join NATO for?” Adenauer paused, thinking."
 Adenauer57.7.d:0 "The German federal government has come under renewed pressure by Western powers to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line, which is currently the border between the Polish People’s Republic and the German Democratic Republic, formed after the Potsdam Conference by the flow of the Oder and Neisse Rivers. While the Americans have especially pressured [WGR.GetLeader] and his cabinet to recognize the line via non-aggression pacts, segments of the German population, particularly the German expellee demographic, have realized his possible motives and are swinging into action against recognition of Poland. Shall the line be recognized?"
 Adenauer57.8.d:0 "It is with regret that Theodor Oberlander, former Minister for Displaced Persons, Refugees, and Victims of War, and member of the Bundestag, has been forced to retire from service with the government of the Federal Republic. With a report earlier this year, Oberlander has been implicated in promoting and committing war crimes in Poland during the Second World War, as well as endorsing ethnic cleansing in Poland, of the people that he soon came to lead as the leader of the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights.\n\nIt is expected that the Adenauer cabinet will make a public statement on this, but will deny the accusations outright and wish Oberlander a safe retirement."
 
 Schumacher49.1.d:0 "Today was yet another turbulent day in the halls of the new Bundestag. In the midst of a fierce debate surrounding the basic functioning of the new West German government, the Opposition Leader, Konrad Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Union, rose to speak.\n\nStanding on the right side of the room with the rest of the CDU behind him, he began. “My fellow members. As we emerge from the horrors of the war with a new and democratic government, the ruling Chancellor, Herr Schumacher, has taken our Federal Republic in a new and dangerous direction. As we try to step back onto the world stage, Herr Schumacher mocks the Allies and desires to pursue greater cooperation with the East-”\n\nHe was cut off by an uproar of fierce boos and heckling from the much larger left side. The boos continued until an SPD deputy approached the dais, raising his voice and interrupting Adenauer.\n\n “Herr Adenauer… I cannot begin to express my, and the party’s contempt with your remarks. The Christian Democratic Union is not only aware of, but complicit in, the sheltering and protection of former National Socialists.”\n\nA gasp went up among nearly the entire room, but the CDU deputies continued to scowl.\n\nHe continued on. “I have in my hand a list of numerous prominent officials within the CDU that were members of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party including Hans Globke and Theodor Oberlander, as well as hundreds and thousands of members, functionaries, and bureaucrats. This half-hearted acceptance of former war criminals and traitors into the conservative movement is unconscionable and undemocratic, and is why we, as the Social Democratic Party, fully condemn the CDU for its actions.”\n\n Raucous applause came throughout the room, as Adenauer appeared shocked, and the CDU either remained quiet or began to heckle towards the other side of the room."
 Schumacher49.2.d:0 "Today was a momentous day in Frankfurt, as a group of officers and men stood outside the Romer, the city hall complex. Dressed in military-style uniforms, but without any insignia, they waited, standing in formation until a group of men in suits emerged, with Chancellor Kurt Schumacher in front. A small group of press and other officials were gathered near the nearly 500 men standing in five square-like formations. Chancellor Schumacher approached the podium, flanked by Vice Chancellor Egon Franke and Federal President Erich Ollenhauer.\n\nHe began. “My fellow citizens, today is an important day; not only for our country’s security, but for the Western world at large. I have the honor to present the first 500 officers and personnel of the new Federal Border Police, or Bundesgrenzschutz. These men will help secure our border from communist threat or incursion, ensure the safety of our transportation networks, and begin to provide policing services on a federal level. I should stress that the BGS is not a military force. The East may accuse us of rearming and will denounce and condemn our actions with harsh rhetoric, but I say one thing. Every country deserves internal peace and security of its’ borders, and Germany should be no different.”\n\nAfter some applause, he was handed a piece of paper from an aide. “I am now honored to give the new oath of the BGS to its first five companies of officers. Raise your right hand.” Five hundred hands were raised.\n\n“I swear to uphold the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and all laws applicable to the Federal Republic, and to conscientiously fulfill my official duties, so help me God!”\n\nCameras flashed as the men immediately started cheering, clapping and tossing their hats into the air. Chancellor Schumacher looked out into the field of feldgrau, then at Ollenhauer and Franke respectively, who both smiled. It was a banner day for the Federal Republic indeed, and more men would be sworn in today, and in the coming days."
 Schumacher49.3.d:0 "Chancellor Schumacher entered the Cabinet meeting room, waltzing in as Vice Chancellor Egon Franke nodded for the ministers to sit. Schumacher sat with a cup of coffee, nodding at the Minister of Foreign Affairs to begin.\n\n “Sir, the Allied Control Commission has given to us the draft text of the Petersberg Agreement. They are heavily pressuring us to sign it, as it includes some allowances for us to pursue some semblance of independent sovereignty.”\n\nSchumacher, after reading some portions of the text, spoke up rather loudly. “What business do the Allies have dictating their demands on our new country? We should refuse to sign and denounce the Allies’ terms as unreasonable.”/n/n Vice Chancellor Franke spoke up. “All due respect to Herr Schumacher, but we really have little choice in this matter. The Western Allies liberated us. These terms seem generally beneficial for us, aside from the Ruhr issue… but we can negotiate that one with them.”\n\nSchumacher piped up again. “Gentlemen, listen. It’s not the terms that I’m opposed to. I have issues with the Allies forcing unreasonable economic and military demands on us in return for a negligible amount of sovereignty. This needs to be done another way, in my opinion.”\n\nFranke looked around the room, saw some nods, some frowns. “Let’s put this to a vote; sign the agreement, or refuse, and make alterations?”"
 Schumacher49.4.d:0 "On radios across Germany, the voice of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher began to boom. Tonight was a memorable moment, as the Chancellery had announced a nationwide speech on new policy matters.\n\n “My fellow Germans. Tonight I am proud to present the new policy program of the Social Democratic Government, one that we have named the ‘Frankfurt Program’ after our shining capital. This program will be separated into three points, which I will go over, all meant to strengthen our country, help our people, and restore our reputation on the world stage.\n\n “First, we will embark on a new Volks economic program, meant to regain our economic power from the postwar damage and the grasp of the Allied Control Commission. This will propel our country to economic levels not seen ever before!”\n\n “Second, the issue of internal political strife has plagued our nation from both sides, both former National Socialists and extant Communists. Our Government will embark upon a harsh program of putting down extremism as a way of fermenting democracy and securing trust in our new institutions.”\n\n “Lastly, our Government will reconsider our foreign policy positions. It has become clear that in some respects, the West German Government and the Allied Powers cannot agree on issues, including the issue of the Ruhr and on militarization. A serious look will be taken at our relations with the powers of Europe and the powers of the world.”\n\n “These three points, in tandem, shall secure our country and help all people. Thank you all and good night.”"
 Schumacher49.5.d:0 "FROM; Provisional Federal Ministry of Economics\nTO; Federal Chancellery\nSubject; Outline of the ‘Volks’ Economy Program\n\nThe West German Government, in its limited provisional capacity, has come up with some crucial points to the new ‘Volks’ Economy Program, the economic segment of the SPD’s Frankfurt Program. Below is a list.\n\n-Formation of a Permanent Federal Ministry of Economics and Unions\n-Introduction of social insurance plans\n-Seizure of Ruhr coal facilities\n-Prioritization of resources for domestic economic use\n-Nationalization of Volkswagen and IG Farben\n-Passage of better working regulations for steel and mine workers\n\nWe believe that these six points have the capability to rebuild our domestic economic and production power."
 Schumacher49.6.d:0 "In Munich’s Marienplatz, a rather large crowd of people gathered, all facing a podium with the West German seal emblazoned on it. As a series of three black Mercedes cars pulled into the square, excitement began to move in the air. Chancellor Schumacher stepped out, flanked as always by Vice Chancellor Franke and President Ollenhauer. After welcoming the attendees, he began.\n\n “I’m sure some of you are wondering why I chose Munich to make this speech. Not only is this one of the most beautiful cities in all of our Republic, but this city has bore witness to political extremism from both sides, from the infamous failed Beer Hall Putsch of the National Socialists to the short-lived Munich Soviet Republic.”\n\n “We have learned from our mistakes of the past, and are fully committed to stamping out the flames of Nazism and Communism from every corner of this country. The ‘Black and Red’ Campaign aims to secure our democracy by punishing and removing all those who aim to overthrow it. Our government will embark on this as soon as possible, while respecting the rights of our people. Thank you all.”\n\n Applause resounded around the square as Schumacher waved, smiling at the audience before motioning for a car."
 Schumacher49.7.d:0 "It was early morning as a black Mercedes rolled down the highway towards the steel mills of the Ruhr. Marked with the insignia of the International Authority for the Ruhr, two men sat, as they turned off the road and approached one of the frequent steel-producing and coal-mining plants dotting the landscape.\n\nIt came as a shock when the car stopped just before the factory’s gate, with a roadblock in front of it, flanked by two Bundesgrenzschutz officers, both with holstered pistols.\n\nRolling the windows down, the Ruhr Authority official driving looked furious. “What’s the meaning of this, Lieutenant?”\n “Sir, this steel mill is officially the property of the Federal Republic of Germany and you are not authorized to enter.”\n “What the hell? We’re with the International Authority for the Ruhr. Here’s our papers. We manage this facility.”\n\n The lieutenant didn’t even bother to examine the documents when handed to him. “Sir, I have direct orders from the Federal Ministry of the Interior to not allow access to any unauthorized personnel into this facility, including Ruhr Authority personnel. Please turn your vehicle around or means of force will be administered.” The officers placed their hands on their holsters.\n\n The two men looked at each other, then at the officers. “This is insane.. Your commanding officer will be hearing about this.” The Mercedes was turned around, and as the car merged back into the highway back towards Dortmund, the man in the passenger seat remarked “Some calls will have to be made.”"
 Schumacher49.8.d:0 "FROM; Chancellor Kurt Schumacher, Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\nTO; President Juan Peron, Government of the Argentine Republic\nSubject; Extradition of Former National Socialists\n\nDear President Peron,\n\nIt has come to the attention of my new government that many former National Socialists, or ‘Nazis’ have fled to countries such as Argentina, who has offered them safe haven from our prosecution or Allied prosecution.\n\n We are aware of the following individuals within Argentina that the Federal Republic of Germany would like to be extradited so that we can prosecute them under our laws;\n\n-Josef Mengele, known as the “Angel of Death”, who committed medical experiments in SS concentration camps\n-Josef Schwammberger, SS Commandant in Poland\n-Erich Priebke, SS commander responsible for the 1944 Ardennes Caves massacre\n-Gerhard Bohne, responsible for the administrative logistics of the Aktion T-4 euthanasia program\n\nExtraditing these individuals into our custody as soon as possible may have some diplomatic benefits in the future."
 Schumacher49.9.d:0 "FROM; Headquarters, Bundesgrenzschutz, Federal Ministry of the Interior\nTO; Chancellor Kurt Schumacher, Federal Chancellery\nSubject; Deportations of Communists to the German Democratic Republic\n\nChancellor,\n\nDeportations of approximately 5,000 registered members of the Communist Party of Germany and other related organizations have been carried out, with all of them being sent to the German Democratic Republic via conventional rail and road routes. All persons have been banned from entering the Federal Republic in the future.\n\nIt is our hope that approximately two to three thousand more individuals will be deported within the coming weeks and sent to the GDR or other bordering communist countries.\n\nSIGNED\nAnton Grasser\nInspector, Bundesgrenzschutz."
 Schumacher49.10.d:0 "Federal Ministry of the Interior, IS Department - Surveillance Log and Profile of Max Reimann\n\nSubject is Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Aged approximately 53 years old, Reimann served on the advisory board of the British Occupation Zone from 1946-1948, becoming chairman of the KPD in 1948. In the 1949 elections, Reimann and his party won approximately 7% of the vote, and is currently serving as a member of the Bundestag.\n\nIdeology\nReimann exhibits average Marxist-Leninist political beliefs and values. In his position as KPD chairman, he has railed against nearly every part of the West German Government, including the Grundgesetz, Federal Chancellor, Federal President, and legal system. Our intelligence indicates this rhetoric will continue and may turn violent based on future events.\n\nSummary of Recent Activity\nOne week ago, Reimann made a statement in the Bundestag condemning not only the CDU, but the ruling SPD party as well for its clear “tolerance of western imperialism”. Two days ago, our intelligence revealed a meeting between Reimann and other western communist party leaders, including Belgian communist Julien Lahaut and French communist Jacques Duclos, as well as telephone calls to East Berlin and SED officials. This represents a major threat to the internal security of the West German Government.\n\nIn conclusion, the Intelligence Division will continue to monitor all movements, statements, telephone conversations and all other forms of communication involving Reimann, and will prepare additional reports as it concerns national security."
 Schumacher49.11.d:0 "As a DC-6 airliner landed at Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Chancellor Schumacher paced in his office. Located miles and miles away from the airport in the city, Schumacher was nervous, understandably. Why wouldn’t he be worried? This would be a massive PR move for the German Government, but McCarthy had been a little more than problematic in US domestic circles.\n\nBefore he knew it, Schumacher was down in Frankfurt’s main square, outside of the Romer, with fanfare, Ollenhauer and Franke behind him, shaking hands with Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the famous American anti-communist.\n\nSitting down to a meeting, the two remained very cordial, with McCarthy thanking Schumacher for inviting him.\n\nDiscussing the intricacies of the Black and Red Campaign, McCarthy seemed impressed, and later, he attended a tour and inspection of BGS units in Frankfurt, noting the professionalism and skill of the BGS troops.\n\nAt the end of the day, Schumacher’s government came out on top - even the CDU is impressed at this show of anti-communist support, while the KPD menaces from the shadows." 
 Schumacher49.12.d:0 "It was yet another standard meeting of the cabinet this morning, and Schumacher was uncharacteristically early, with Ollenhauer and Franke being shocked to see him be one of the first in the room, with his normal cup of coffee. As the rest of the ministers arrived in the room, sitting down, Schumacher started the meeting.\n\n “Gentlemen, we must discuss the intricacies of the third point of our government program - the foreign policy aspect. We must agree on a path forward on the world stage. I’ll now take any suggestions.”\n\n Franke immediately started speaking. “Herr Chancellor, we must, and I mean must, continue with our policy of Western integration. It is the only way forward. I say this as a proud SPD member, but the West can truly help us in ways that we would never imagine.”\n\nOllenhauer retorted. “Herr Vice Chancellor, I disagree strongly. Why should we kneel to the West even more than we have already? Dealing with the Petersberg Agreement was only the first test in this. There are members of this government who want an independent Germany, not constrained by any power or bloc, and I believe that is what’s best for our people right now, not being pulled in any direction by the East, or the West.\n\nSchumacher had heard enough. Attracting the attention of all the ministers in the room, he called a vote; continue with Western integration, or pursue a non-aligned path?"
 Schumacher49.13.d:0 "To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing on behalf of the West German Government, concerning the Allied Control Commission’s push for West German rearmament.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party has considered it inadvisable for Germany to rearm for the safety of its people and strongly condemns the rhetoric of the CDU and Allied Powers in forcing German rearmament as a ploy for Germany to be the next battleground in this “Cold War” of ours.\n\nThe German people seek safety and security, from the posturing of the East, or the West. We condemn all attempts to rearm in the near future; the foundation of our Federal Border Service was only meant to secure ourselves internally and will never be used for external use. Any further attempts to convince us of this will not be viewed positively. Thank you."
 Schumacher49.14.d:0 "After Schumacher’s cabinet decided to move forward with Western integration, against the wishes of Ollenhauer, the next topic of discussion was the Schuman Plan, a proposed economic agreement with the French that would create a “European Coal and Steel Community” drafted by French foreign minister Robert Schuman.\n\nFranke started the discussion, saying “This seems as a fairly easy decision. If we desire to continue with Western integration, this is one of the necessary steps in doing so. The mere fact that the French trust us after the last half-century of history between our two countries is a good sign, and I see no reason why we refuse to enter into this history-making agreement.” He had made a good argument, even eliciting applause from those ministers more aligned with Ollenhauer.\n\nSchumacher acknowledged this, but then motioned to his Federal President to speak.\n\n “Herr Franke, I see many reasons why we shouldn’t join this agreement. It is clear that ever since the Petersberg Agreement was given to us, we have been forced to bow to the Western Allies and do whatever they wish. This is clearly what the CDU wants to do - why should we commit to the same policy? How do we know that the French, in their proposed ECSC, won’t simply take our coal and steel for themselves,  just like they took the Ruhr in 1923?”\n\nThis last point caused the room to erupt in a chorus of general displeasure, opposition and anger.\n\nSchumacher had heard enough. “Order! Gentlemen, let’s behave like politicians and vote on this!”"
 Schumacher49.15.d:0 "It was a sunny day in Washington as a crowd gathered in the Foxhall Village neighborhood of the District, just west of Georgetown. The new German Cultural Center, or Deutsches Kulturzentrum, had finished construction merely weeks ago, and now, officials from the Federal Republic and the United States had arrived to dedicate and open the building to the public. Chancellor Schumacher was not present, as he was busy, but Federal President Erich Ollenhauer had been sent in his ceremonial duties as head of state, albeit begrudgingly.\n\nOllenhauer had told himself that this was still a good thing, cultural exchange was important between countries, but seemed bitter that Schumacher asked him specifically; a man who supported not joining the West, to go to the West and hobnob with American diplomats.\n\nShaking hands with US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, the two discussed the intricacies of cultural exchange, suggesting maybe future student exchange programs in the future. Exchanging cordialities was something that Ollenhauer disliked, but it was part of his job, and as the two discussed the difference between German bratwurst and Austrian schnitzel, pairs of scissors were handed to them by aides.\n\n “It must be time,” Ollenhauer said, smiling slightly at Acheson, as they walked to the ribbon wrapped near the front of the building. As cameras flashed, the two smiled as they cut the ribbon, marking the official opening of the German Cultural Center and continued cooperation and support between the United States and West Germany."
 Schumacher49.16.d:0 "As we return to the Bundestag chamber again, a fierce debate was raging, this time concerning the status of Allied occupation forces in West Germany. The president of the chamber was attempting to gavel the CDU member speaking down, who was screaming about the “SPD’s incompetence in our national defense” and the “need for American troops”. Once some semblance of quiet was reached, an SPD member rose to speak, beginning.\n\n “How could the CDU and their partners be so brainwashed and confused is beyond me. All due respect to the mission of the Allied occupation forces, but their presence is unwanted, unwarranted at this point, and they are taking up valuable resources that our country needs to rebuild. We have a stable, social democratic government, and we do not need foreign troops patrolling our streets and driving their tanks down our autobahns. The BGS is enough to solve our internal security issues, we do not need Americans doing it for us. I therefore ask this chamber to vote on a resolution asking for the voluntary departure of Allied occupation forces from our country.”\n\nThe room exploded in chaos of heckling, general displeasure, raucous cheers and applause from the SPD side, and yells of “Maintain the status quo” from the CDU and FDP. The president banged his gavel to restore order, then saying “I declare a vote on this resolution. Voting will commence now by secret ballot.”"
 Schumacher49.17.d:0 "FROM; Chancellor Kurt Schumacher, Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\nTO; Max Petitpierre, President of the Federal Council of Switzerland, and Tage Erlander, Prime Minister of Sweden\nSubject; European Neutrality\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. As you know, the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany is pursuing a non-aligned form of diplomacy, pushing away the influence of the Western and Eastern Blocs. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has viewed the Republic of Austria and the Kingdom of Sweden as two neutral, potentially friendly countries that the Federal Republic would like to further relations with, in our fight against superpowers in this “Cold War.” I hope to work further with your countries in the future."
 Schumacher49.18.d:0 "As the plane began its approach to Belgrade Airport, Schumacher finished his glass of cognac, having it whisked away before the plane bounced to a stop. It was late afternoon, as Schumacher was welcomed by a brass band and formation of troops of the Yugoslav People’s Army. Shaking hands with the Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, Schumacher was taken to a car, which whisked him away to the center of Belgrade, where he was met with similar fanfare by the General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Josep Broz Tito. Exchanging pleasantries, the two men and their diplomatic counterparts soon got to business; this was no ordinary diplomatic visit.\n\nThe two talked about the similarities between their countries; Tito’s experience with Stalin, and Schumacher’s experience with the Western Allies. Both agreed that the tactics of the Western and Eastern Blocs were corrosive to their people, and while Schumacher hated communism with a burning passion, he had fundamental respect for Tito, a man who truly cared about his people.\n\nThe trip lasted a week, with both parties agreeing to open formal diplomatic relations and continue friendly relations in the future."

 SchuStroke.1.d:0 "As the maid rapped on the door to Chancellor Kurt Schumacher’s private bedroom, she became increasingly more and more worried. This was unlike him to still not be awake so late, especially as a cabinet meeting was to occur in less than an hour.\n\nFumbling with a ring of keys, she finally managed to get the door open, and looking in, she saw the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Kurt Schumacher himself, slumped over in bed, unconscious. The maid let out a blood-curdling scream, attracting the attention of passing butlers and other chancellerial staff, who rushed in with similar reactions of shock.\n\nOut of nowhere, Schumacher’s chief of staff, Dietrich Steube arrived, trying to calm the situation down.\n\n “Get the Vice Chancellor and Federal President down here right now! Assemble the cabinet, but tell Franke he’s in charge until we can get the situation dealt with.”\n\nPointing at the assembled staff, he said, “Call for the Chancellor’s doctor! We need to get him to a hospital immediately!”"
 SchuStroke.2.d:0 "Only a short few hours after the discovery of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher having a stroke, the Cabinet of the Federal Republic assembled, led provisionally by Vice Chancellor Egon Franke. While Federal President Erich Ollenhauer wasn’t required to be there, he was in the room anyway, especially considering the discussion would center around the recent leadership change.\n\nThe Cabinet was shocked, as the ministers whispered to each other. Franke opened the meeting.\n\n “I’m sure all of us are rightfully concerned and shocked to hear that the Chancellor had a stroke this morning in his residence. I have been assured that he is being taken care of at the Hospital of the Holy Spirit and is in stable condition.” A sigh of relief blew through the room.\n\n “Now, we must come to the core subject of this Cabinet meeting. There is no clear line of succession for if the Chancellor is incapacitated or killed, and now that we are faced with this potential situation, a decision must be made.”\n\nOllenhauer spoke up from the corner of the room. “As Vice Chancellor Franke is not explicitly the legal successor of Chancellor Schumacher, he should not be the country’s leader at this point.” The room became a little louder at this point but Ollenhauer kept talking.\n\n “The Federal President is the head of state and therefore, is in a better position to act as the country’s temporary leader.”\n\nFranke shot back. “As the Vice Chancellor, I am the Chancellor’s direct successor, nominated by him directly. What more reason would I have?”\n\nA minister spoke up. “We must vote on this. Whatever the case may be, the Bundestag will have to vote on the successor assuming that the Chancellor is not able to recover.” Franke nodded. “Very well then. Herr Ollenhauer, may the best man win. Please record your vote on a slip of paper and deposit it with the chief of staff, who will count the votes.”"
 SchuStroke.3.d:0 "“With the advice and consent of the West German Cabinet, Vice Chancellor Egon Franke has been confirmed as the temporary Chancellor of West Germany, in the wake of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher’s recent stroke. As a personal pick of Schumacher upon arriving in office, Franke is uniquely qualified to lead the country in this time of great need.”\n\nFranke smiled at the front-page article in Frankfurt’s largest newspaper. Turning to the small group of people in the Chancellery, he placed his left hand on a copy of the Basic Law, and raised his right hand.\n\n “I swear that I will dedicate my strength to the well-being of the German people, enhance what is to its advantage, ward off what might harm it, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, fulfill my duties conscientiously and do justice to every man, so help me God.”\n\nAmid raucous applause, one figure was not clapping; Erich Ollenhauer, the Federal President, who, as constitutionally required, was present at the swearing in. Hopefully, he thought, this wouldn’t last long."
 SchuStroke.4.d:0 "“With the advice and consent of the West German Cabinet, Federal President Erich Ollenhauer has been confirmed as the temporary Chancellor of West Germany, in the wake of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher’s recent stroke. As Schumacher’s counterpart as head of state, Ollenhauer is ideologically aligned with Schumacher, much to the chagrin of Vice Chancellor Egon Franke, who holds a more right-wing view in the SPD. However, Ollenhauer has proven himself during his time as Federal President as being ready and willing for the challenge ahead of him.”\n\n Ollenhauer smiled, reading the article in the front page of Frankfurt’s largest newspaper. Turning to the small group of officials in the Chancellery, he placed his left hand on a copy of the Basic Law, and raised his right hand.\n\n “I swear that I will dedicate my strength to the well-being of the German people, enhance what is to its advantage, ward off what might harm it, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, fulfill my duties conscientiously and do justice to every man, so help me God.”\n\nAmid raucous applause, stood a man who was placed in a precarious situation; Egon Franke, still as the current Vice Chancellor, a rival of Ollenhauer, now sidelined as his second-in-command. Hopefully, he thought, this wouldn’t last long."
 SchuStroke.5.d:0 "As Ollenhauer came into the cabinet room, he was confused. Only weeks into his temporary duties as Chancellor, he had a diplomatic situation to defuse.\n\nDirecting his attention to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ollenhauer began to listen.\n\n “Herr Chancellor, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin has put forth proposals for German reunification, assuming that we are neutral and guarantee “the rights of man and basic freedoms”. Allied officials are suspicious that the “Stalin Notes” are simply a bluff for the Soviets to blame the Allies for a divided Germany. Sir, we need to handle this as soon as possible.”\n\nOllenhauer spoke. “As much as I appreciate our colleagues in Washington and London, they seem to label nearly everything as a Soviet plot against them. I believe that Germany should be neutral in this new and rapidly expanding Cold War - but if it’s on the Soviets’ terms, I would not be so quick to judge.”\n\nFranke began to speak. “Sir, while I agree, I must strongly protest. We should not be giving this Soviet ploy any more time. Unification is important, but not under these circumstances.”\n\nOllenhauer nodded. “Very well, Herr Franke. Let’s put this to a vote.”"
 SchuStroke.6.d:0 "Ever since the tragic stroke suffered by Chancellor Schumacher, the debate on succession in the Government has raged. In order to solve this issue, a group of SPD politicians led by Provisional Chancellor Ollenhauer have put forward an amendment to the Basic Law laying down a line of succession for the Federal Chancellor in the future. Meant as an complement to Article 57, the amendment is read as follows:\n\n “In the event of the inability of the Federal Chancellor to perform the duties of his office or in the event of a premature vacancy in the office, the functions of the Federal Chancellor will be held by the Federal President, followed by the Vice Chancellor and the President of the Bundesrat.”\n\nIn private discussions, Vice Chancellor Egon Franke has considered this a sidelining of his authority, especially after his ousting as Chancellor during the initial succession crisis. It is expected to pass the Bundestag, particularly as a bipartisan issue to the succession issue of several weeks ago."
 SchuStroke.7.d:0 "With much fanfare, Kurt Schumacher returned to the Federal Chancellery in Frankfurt, returning from his recovery and rehabilitation at Hospital of the Holy Spirit from his stroke. While preparing to be re-sworn in, Schumacher received meetings with the Provisional Chancellor, Federal President and other officials. Ollenhauer, sounding rather pleased to see Schumacher return, wished him well and was pleased to go back to Federal President with Schumacher’s return. Franke’s reaction though, was rather different. All being for preserving the line of succession and rule of law, he felt sidelined by Schumacher and Ollenhauer’s amicable relationship, and even being the Chancellor’s pick for deputy, he was chagrined to return to his old role.\n\nWith his hand on the same copy of the Basic Law as was used for the swearing in of former Chancellor [WGR.GetLeader], Kurt Schumacher was back!"
 SchuStroke.8.d:0 "It was another raucous day in the Bundestag, but this time concerning a different issue. After the recent return of Kurt Schumacher as Chancellor, the CDU and FDP had understandable opposition to his reappointment, considering it a political move to consolidate SPD power.\n\n A CDU deputy rose to continue the debate, beginning. “Let’s look at this logically, something I know my colleagues on the left aren’t capable of doing.” Laughter from the CDU, boos from the SPD side.\n\n “The Chancellor suffers a stroke, god help him. He is replaced by another SPD minister as a Provisional Chancellor, as the line of succession is debated to death. But, Chancellor Schumacher comes back? And the German people are supposed to be fine with this? The transition from one minister to another, without any oversight from the Bundestag, or from the people directly? Is Chancellor Schumacher’s condition even really stable? He’s already suffered one stroke, what’s to say he won’t suffer another?”\n\n He was quickly stopped by a chorus of boos and yelling, even from some members of his own party. The crack at Schumacher’s condition had gone too far, but the SPD would have to respond to this, as a deputy stood up to speak.\n\n “To respond to the CDU deputy to my left - your comments about the Chancellor’s condition are unwarranted and not appropriate in this chamber! And to address the concerns levied about the transition; it was necessary to maintain the stability and working government of the Federal Republic while the Chancellor rested and recovered. Since his condition has improved, he was reappointed as Chancellor, mostly because he was duly elected by the people to serve. The CDU would have done the same had it happened to Herr Adenauer.”\n\n Shocked silence from the CDU side echoed. No one rose to speak. Meanwhile, the SPD deputies looked over with smirks, not even laughing. The SPD wins again."
 SchuStroke.9.d:0 ""Schumacher sat in his office one rainy Saturday night, reminiscing on the past few years. Winning the Chancellery, becoming the first SPD leader of Germany in decades, accomplishing leaps and bounds in policy, only to have it all come crashing down with his stroke and recovery. There had been the whole business of the succession which the CDU and its propaganda apparatus had attempted to tear to pieces. Schumacher had done all that he could, and between the two deputies fighting over SPD rule, one aligned more with Schumacher’s ideology and policy: Erich Ollenhauer.\n\nIt was time to prep him, whether Franke liked it or not. Looking out the window, he buzzed for his secretary.\n\n “Bring Erich in.”
 SchuDeath.1.d:0 "All the staff had known for a while that this would come. Ollenhauer had been informed on Schumacher’s condition daily in the past few months since he had returned, and the contingency plan had been drawn up.\n\nThe two were talking one morning in the Chancellor’s office, and in the midst of chatting over policy, Schumacher stopped suddenly.\n\n “Erich, I’ve been thinking.” \n\n “What about, Herr Chancellor?”\n\n “Erich, it’s my legacy. We’ve done so much, and even while I was gone, how will I be remembered?”\n\n “Sir, you are the first SPD Chancellor in decades; we’ve built up the country, built a bulwark against extremism and reset our foreign policy.”\n\n Schumacher looked relieved. “Yes, I suppose so-”\n\nHe gasped, clutching his chest, falling to the ground.\n\nOllenhauer, trying to do the best he could, helped Schumacher into a more comfortable position, then moving to the desk, dialing the rotary phone.\n\n “Herr Doktor? It’s Erich. It’s happened again, probably for good.”\n\n The doctors rushed in again, as Ollenhauer said he had done all he could. This time, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Kurt Schumacher, really was dead."
 SchuDeath.2.d:0 "As Ollenhauer settled into the chair in the Chancellor’s office, he recalled all that had happened the past few months. It was now over, as Ollenhauer and his clique had solidified himself as the SPD’s future, at least until the 1953 federal elections.\n\nFranke and his group of Kanalarbeiters on the SPD’s opposition had been quietly threatening protests, but Ollenhauer had managed to talk them down, out of a sense of unity within the SPD.\n\nThere was much to do, and not much time, until the elections. A state funeral to plan, a government to form, a country to stabilize and mourn for a few months. A campaign to win the next four years. Ollenhauer steeled himself and began to sort through papers."
 SchuDeath.3.d:0 "It was an early Monday morning in the Federal Chancellery, as the staff arrived in ones and twos, turning on lights, starting the coffee machine and beginning drafting the usual policy and briefing reports.\n\nAt 7:30 am, Ollenhauer’s chief of staff Dietrich Steube arrived at the office, smiling at all the underlings already busy at work. He had not even finished pouring his first cup of coffee of the morning when a group of men, all dressed in suits, barged into the corridor outside his office, advancing on him, led by Vice Chancellor Egon Franke.\n\n “What’s the meaning of this?” Stuebe nearly yelled, before being cut off.\n\n “WE are here to protest, Herr Steube. This coup by Herr Ollenhauer and his minions has gone far enough; first the Succession Crisis, and now this?” As more men filed into the room behind him, while others moved around the building, standing with their arms folded, smirking. “We, the Kanalarbeiters, the real representatives of the SPD, demand JUSTICE for this issue, and we demand it now!”\n\nSteube simply looked with shock, sputtering. Franke continued. “We are not going to leave the Chancellery until this matter is constructively solved once and for all, when the Chancellor himself will allow all members of the SPD to work in the government, and if possible, resign his position!”\n\nJust then, all the members turned around as Ollenhauer walked down the corridor towards his adjoining office, stopping to observe the commotion.\n\n “What’s all this about, Steube?” “Sir, Franke and the Kanalarbeiters are occupying the building and are refusing to leave until we rectify the leadership issue.”\n\n “Very well then, how can we settle this, Egon?”"
 SchuDeath.4.d:0 "Since the election of Kurt Schumacher and the Social Democratic Party into power in 1949 as the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic, the SPD has become increasingly divided between the plaintiff (Herr Franke) and the defendant (Herr Ollenhauer), as they disagree on various matters of policy and ideology as it relates to the SPD.\n\nThe conflict became more overt after the first stroke of Kurt Schumacher, placing the government in a succession crisis that ended with the two in a dead-locked influence battle.\n\nThe plaintiff, Egon Franke, argues that the succession of Erich Ollenhauer, his rival, upon Schumacher’s untimely death was a coup against the SPD, against the people, and that his group, known as the Kanalarbeiters (or Sewer Workers) are not given any say in the SPD government policy. Crucially, he has expounded that Schumacher’s return to office was a deliberate move to legitimize Erich Ollenhauer as the next SPD leader as opposed to him.\n\nHowever, Ollenhauer and his government argue that Schumacher was very specific about naming a successor, and that since the government has been plagued by a succession crisis twice now, it is necessary to nominate Ollenhauer until the next election. Ollenhauer has pushed back on this case but has not dismissed it out of respect for the democratic process and the court system.\n\nA decision will need to be made as to whether to keep Ollenhauer or allow Franke to serve provisionally until the election."
 SchuDeath.5.d:0 "It was a rainy morning as Franke, tailed by a few staffers, entered a conference room in the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party in Frankfurt, where two CDU officials were sitting; Konrad Adenauer, the Opposition Leader, and Ludwig Erhard, his deputy. Franke sat down, at the opposite end of the table, and the two groups began to talk.\n\n “Thank you for coming, Herr Franke.”\n “It’s my pleasure, Herr Adenauer. I’m glad we can come to a mutual agreement, even if our parties are in stiff opposition.” \n\n “We must figure out what to do about Herr Ollenhauer. He presents a threat to both of us. You may be part of his party, but there are clear differences.”\n\n “Precisely why I came to meet with you. Ollenhauer’s SPD members have a majority in the Bundestag, but my group, the Kanalarbeiters, are willing to vote with the CDU and FDP on issues that go against the Chancellor’s agenda. If he must be Chancellor, we will make it as hard as possible for him until the election.”\n\nAdenauer looked rather pleased, and gave a glance to Erhard, who nodded. “Very well then, I’m quite glad we could meet to discuss this.”\n\nThe two men, Franke and Adenauer, shook hands, then smiled as Franke strode out of the room."
 SchuDeath.6.d:0 "A momentous day was occurring in the Chancellery yet again, as the government was changing hands for what felt like the fifth time in a year. Franke, surrounded by staffers and officials, raised his right hand and repeated the oath of the Federal Chancellor, ushering in the way for a provisional caretaker government until the election.\n\nUltimately, Franke had won out, not just in the legal sense of the Federal Constitutional Court case, but on an influential level as well, rallying the public against Ollenhauer and towards a more right-leaning, conservative brand of social democracy.\n\nOllenhauer was there, as the departing Chancellor, and handled it with some grace, but reckoning that this would be the end of his time in federal politics, at the very least."
 SchuDeath.7.d:0 "“Citizens of Germany, there has been a lot of talk and protests surrounding my accession to Chancellor after Kurt Schumacher’s untimely death by stroke, God rest his soul.”\n\nOllenhauer spoke on the radio, on a typical weeknight, as his predecessor typically did.\n\n “It was necessary to continue the path of a stable government, particularly after the first succession crisis earlier this year. My rivals within the party, particularly Herr Franke, have accused me of a coup, and I understand the perception in seeing that; but you must understand, my time in office is only until the 1953 election; if you, the people, decide to vote SPD, that is certainly your right to do so. But if a new government comes into office, the Basic Law will be followed and I will step down. I can only hope that you the people will make the right decision for your country, and I will continue to serve in this government to the best of my ability until that time. Good night.”\n\nAs the radio technician motioned that he was off the air, Ollenhauer sighed. Hopefully this would be the trick to convince the people that he was the legitimate chancellor, at least for now. He had subtly mentioned the election as a way to nudge people to vote SPD, but after this mess with Schumacher, he had less confidence in the polling numbers. Hopefully it would all work out, he thought."
 SchuDeath.8.d:0 "It was a somber day, in the main square outside the Romer in Frankfurt, as the city had virtually come to a standstill on today, the day of the state funeral of former Chancellor Kurt Schumacher. As mourners lined the streets, a horse-drawn carriage, carrying the casket of Schumacher, draped with the new German flag, approached the square, coming to a stop in the center, where a stage was located. Several thousand senior government officials and dignitaries from not only the Federal Republic, but the US, UK, and France were there, as well as other European allies.\n\nOllenhauer came out to deliver the eulogy, as was specifically requested by his friend.\n\n “Citizens of Germany and assembled dignitaries. Today we come together to celebrate the life and accomplishments of a truly great man and a great leader of the Federal Republic during one of its most pivotal moments as a new nation. Kurt truly pioneered the idea of modern German social democracy and his policies, including de-extremism, economic rebuilding and foreign policy restructuring have set our country on a truly great path. We must recognize his achievements and his failures, and his untimely health issues ended his life’s work much too soon.”\n\nAs he said this, the entire crowd erupted in applause, as a line of 7 BGS soldiers, armed with rifles, raised them and fired.\n\nCrack. A click as they reloaded. Crack. A click. A final, third crack.\n\nAs the squad returned their weapons to “attention”, a bugler began to play, as 2 more BGS soldiers lifted the German flag off the casket and began to fold it. Some people began to cry, while everyone else looked forlorn. It truly was a sad day for Germany."
 SchuDeath.9.d:0 "Even after Schumacher’s funeral and Ollenhauer’s public announcement, tensions had still risen to a point. In Munich, pro-Franke protestors occupied Bavarian government offices, prompting BGS forces to be deployed.\n\nIn Frankfurt, the Romer and other squares were filled with protestors, holding signs against corruption, shouting anti-Ollenhauer slurs and cursing the police and the government.\n\nBecause of proximity to the Chancellery, the BGS was deployed to the square, armed with riot gear and batons, quickly engaging the most violent and inflammatory protestors, slamming them to the ground and arresting them.\n\nStill forced to retreat to closer to the building, a helicopter armed with tear gas canisters circled over the square, dropping the gas and sending protestors fleeing towards the side streets, right into the arms of Frankfurt police and BGS troopers."

 Ollenhauer53.1.d:0 "As the Chancellor walked into the cabinet room this morning, everyone assembled knew that the subject would be one of the more important debates of the new Ollenhauer government.\n\nAs Ollenhauer sat down, the tension in the room was thick, as no one really wanted to talk about this issue, but it would have to be discussed. The Chancellor began.\n\n “On the topic of the Bundesgrenzschutz - the BGS, the Border Guard, whatever you want to call them. What should our military policy be?”\n\nImmediately, two blocs formed within the cabinet ministers; predictably, a pro-Ollenhauer faction, and the minority of Kanalarbeiter ministers placed in the government to appease Franke. “We should build up the BGS!” yelled a minister from the latter group.\n\n “No! They are the Border Guard! Look at what happened the last time this country tried to build up a defensive army!”\n\nThis set off quite a verbal battle, as ministers on both sides yelled about the benefits and risks of making the BGS larger.\n\nOllenhauer slammed his hand on the table to call for order. He then faced the pro-arming faction, asking them, “How would you go about growing the BGS?”\n\n “Very simply, Herr Ollenhauer, we would submit a bill to authorize more units, fortify the border, and introduce policies to shift the force to a more military component as opposed to a police unit.”\n\n “Very well then, let’s hear from the other side.” A junior minister on the other side of the table spoke up. “Well, we believe that the BGS was founded as a border guard and federal police only - there is no reason to change their mission so massively. What both sides can agree on is the security of our borders, and the BGS does that well enough, without the need for a larger military force.”\n\n Ollenhauer nodded, understanding both sides’ arguments. “Well, we should come to a decision. Should the BGS be expanded, or stay as its current force?”"
 Ollenhauer53.2.d:0 "As the assembled Bundestag murmured among themselves in the large chambers, Ollenhauer stepped in, taking the podium; putting on a pair of glasses; clearing his throat.\n\n “Assembled members of the Bundestag; I am here, as usual, to report on the status of the Federal Republic and to outline my agenda for the next year. We have accomplished much this year, and this government has been through quite a lot. With the passing of former Chancellor Schumacher, the country was thrown into chaos once again. The party had its challenges from that, but ultimately, I was chosen as Chancellor.”\n\nThe last sentence caused a little bit of noise in the room, as some quietly stated their objections to Ollenhauer, but he continued to keep talking.\n\n “It is critical that we weather through this stormy time as a united nation. This new international environment is quickly becoming a dangerous place, and while I intend to improve the lives of all Germans, young and old, of all creeds; the divisive politics, not only from within my own party, but from across the aisle, need to be remedied. Thus, my administration will be working towards healing the divisions that have appeared, and taking our country on a more neutral and pragmatic foreign policy path, considering ideological calls from both sides of the Iron Curtain. I pledged my sacred honor upon these ideals taking the helm of Chancellor, and this I swear to do for all the people of Germany!”\n\nThis last part elicited applause, from not only the SPD side, but the CDU; even their deputies were impressed.\n\nPundits were pleasantly surprised by the diplomatic tone of Ollenhauer, and are curious about the future of German intra-political relations under Ollenhauer."
 Ollenhauer53.3.d:0 "It was a sunny morning in Frankfurt as an unexpected visitor entered the Federal Chancellery. It was quite uncommon these days for CDU party officials to enter the Chancellery, as they usually brooded in groups at their headquarters or in the Bundestag chambers. But, today, this was no standard visit, nor a standard visitor. It was no one other than Ludwig Erhard, who calmly walked past a few confused aides straight back to the conference room where most of the Federal Republic’s business is done. He sat down, across from Ollenhauer’s chief of staff, as well as a few other SPD officials and political advisors.\n\n “What can I do for you gentlemen on this fine day?”\n\nOllenhauer’s chief of staff began. “Well, Herr Erhard, we have a proposition for you. Since we have decided to open up more positive relations with your party, the Chancellor wants to offer you the position of Minister of Economics for his new government. We cannot think of anyone more qualified to determine our economic policies and cooperation from across the aisle would help to cement public support for this government.”\n\nErhard appeared a little thrown by this. “Well, I’m honored. I see no reason why my party would have any problems with this; but I must ask one question: why me? Does the SPD not have anyone qualified enough to lead economic policy?”\n\nThis elicited some frowns from the SPD officials. “Well, your resume says enough for itself. Director of Economics in the Bizone and your subsequent work on currency reform in 1948. Herr Erhard, you created the Deutsche Mark entirely! Why shouldn’t we have asked you earlier?”\n\n “Again, I’m honored. Let me discuss with some of my party members, but I have no doubt that I’ll take the position, and I thank you profusely for offering it to me.”\n\nShaking hands and putting out his cigar in the ashtray, Erhard smiled before leaving. Ollenhauer’s chief of staff and the assorted officials in the room looked back at him leaving, then smiled at each other. This was a major win."
 Ollenhauer53.4.d:0 "It was another busy day at the Chancellery as Ollenhauer’s chief of staff, Dietrich Steube, went about his job of reading briefings and checking documents from his aides, when the phone rang. Picking up the rotary phone, it was the building’s switchboard.\n\n“Herr Steube, outside call from the Special Commission for National Socialist Investigations.”\n\n There was a click. “Herr Steube?”\n“Yes, who am I speaking to?”\n “I’m a member of the Nazi-investigating commission. There’s some information you should know.”\n“What is it?”\n“We have credible information that a member of your cabinet was a Nazi collaborator during the war.”\n“Who?” \n“Herbert Kriedemann.”\n\n“Thank you.” Click.\n\n Steube hung up the phone in silence, at once getting up to enter the Chancellor’s office.\n\n “Herr Chancellor, we have a situation.”\n\nOllenhauer looked up from his desk, where he was busy signing papers. “Yes, Dietrich?”\n\n“We have credible information that an SPD member, Herbert Kriedemann, collaborated with the Gestapo during the war. A more detailed summary is being sent from the Special Commission for National Socialist Investigations now, but we need to decide what to do before the press gets hold of this information.”\n\n“What does he do in our government?”\n\n“He’s one of the Parliamentary State Secretaries for the Ministry for Food and Agriculture.”\n\nThere was a pause. “Herr Chancellor, we could quietly fire him, or we could take this opportunity to make an example out of him and show the nation that we do not tolerate Nazi collaborators in our midst.”\n\nOllenhauer pondered for a moment, before turning back to Steube and saying..."
 Ollenhauer53.5.d:0 "After Chancellor Ollenhauer’s decision to begin televised public hearings into government officials and their ties to National Socialists in the past, the media began getting ready. The new ARD network immediately began installing cameras in the Bundestag committee chambers, as the deliberations of the Special Commission for National Socialist Investigations became televised for the first time.\n\n “Herr Kriedemann, were you not a collaborator affiliated with the National Socialist Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo, in January 1934?”\n\nA pause. “Yes, Chairman, I was.”\n\n “And were you not in contact with a Gestapo Agent Reinhold Schwabe, during that time?”\n\n Another pause. “Yes, Chairman, I was.”\n\n “In the judgment of the Hanover Regional Court dated 31 May 1949, ‘The files speak so conclusively for the activity of Kriedemann in the interest of the Gestapo… that the words “Gestapo informer” in the context of the factual allegations do not overshoot their content in form’. What do you have to say to this, Herr Kriedemann?”\n\nThere was an extremely long pause this time, as the crowd behind Kriedemann chittered to themselves, with whispers of “Gestapo?” being heard.\n\n “Well, Chairman... yes. I worked with the Gestapo. It was... regrettable. But, I had very few options... and I thought it would work out. The party apparatus was in Prague at the time...”\n\nHe was cut off. “Herr Kriedemann, thank you for appearing. That’ll be all. The BGS officers will escort you out now.”\n\nKriedemann, getting up, looked shameful as a group of BGS officers gathered around him, walking him out of the chamber, as jeers and yelling of “Traitor!” followed. This was only the beginning, as the Special Commission would get to the bottom of all Nazi collaborators within the SPD government."
 Ollenhauer53.6.d:0 "Ollenhauer had been regretting this moment for a long time, but it had to come. Steube, his chief of staff, had insisted on handling the matter, but Ollenhauer had refused - he had personal experience.\n\nHelga, Ollenhauer’s secretary, opened the door, and Kriedemann walked in, looking rather sheepish, along with Steube. Motioning for them to sit down, Ollenhauer began.\n\n “I’m sure you know what this is about, Herr Kriedemann.”\n\n “Yes, Herr Chancellor, I do.”\n\n “Yes, Herbert. The Special Commission for National Socialist Investigations has informed us of your collusion with the Gestapo before and during the war, and has evidence to prove it.”\nHe sighed.\n “Herbert, I want to ask something of you. Why did you do it? Why did you work with them? You knew what would come out of this, the betrayal of your party and of your comrades, your friends...”\n\nKriedemann looked up. “Herr Chancellor, I agreed to meet with them in 1936. You knew that, you were in the party apparatus in Prague at the time. You knew of my actions. I thought it would appease them long enough to respect me. I was so wrong.”\n\nOllenhauer replied, “You know what situation this puts me in? We accuse the CDU of being the party of Nazis, and suddenly we have a Parliamentary State Secretary who worked for the Gestapo? Look. I could have made a public example out of you, but for the party, and for your image, the Chancellery will keep it quiet.” Ollenhauer paused for a moment. “Herbert, you’re fired. The Minister for Food, Agriculture and Forests will be let known, we will issue a statement indicating you wanted to retire from the government, and you’ll be given severance pay. My chief of staff, Herr Steube, will work out the details. That’ll be all.”\n\nKriedemann smiled somewhat. “Thank you, Herr Chancellor. I wish good luck for your government, and I regret my past choices.”\n\nHe then walked out of the office, flanked by Steube, who shot Ollenhauer an approving glance. It was done."
 Ollenhauer53.7.d:0 "It was a momentous day in the Hamburg suburb of Stade, as a long line of black Mercedes rolled into the new Stade Nuclear Power Plant complex for its opening.\n\nSmiling at the assembled press and power plant personnel, all wearing hard hats, Ollenhauer himself donned a bright yellow plastic hard helmet, emblazoned with the federal eagle logo. Looking on with flashing cameras, Ollenhauer posed with a comically large pair of scissors, as he and his Minister of the Interior, as well as the power plant manager, cut the ribbon draped over the entrance to the cooling tower.\n\nAfter, he received a tour of the facility, inspecting the control room, pump facilities, as well as giving a short speech in the administrative building.\n\n “This is truly a historic day for Germany, as we have harnessed the power of the atom for the first time within our borders and can use it to power our peoples’ homes, jobs, and livelihoods.”"
 Ollenhauer53.8.d:0 "“Across Germany, protests began in the streets, as word from Frankfurt came down that the Ollenhauer government had plans to ban religious schools. The largest protests happening in Munich, the state capital of Catholic-majority Bavaria, indicate a general displeasure among the populace with the new policy, and provide a warning to the Chancellery.”\n\nOllenhauer closed the local morning newspaper, looking at Steube. “Well, did we predict this in advance?”\n\n “Well, Herr Chancellor, it figures that the Catholics would oppose our secular school policies, but we didn’t figure it would escalate to protests.”\n\n “Very well then, we ought to make a decision on whether we should carry on. After all, the Education Standardization Act has already passed, but it will not go into effect until next month.”\n\n “Yes, sir. Should we show good faith and repeal it, or continue with our stated policies and push through the bill, and deal with the aftermath later?” Ollenhauer paused to think, as he was prone to do."
 Ollenhauer53.9.d:0 "In Munich, the local BGS commander was sitting in his office, when the phone rang. He had read similar articles in the newspaper about protests happening locally in Munich, and he, for one, was generally indifferent about religious schools; he, like most Bavarians, was Catholic, but his children were in public school. Ja, but the phone was ringing.\n\n “Hello?”\n\n “Hauptmann Strasse, protestors are moving from the Frauenkirchen to the Marienplatz, down the Kaufingerstrasse. Local BGS and Munich police units are overwhelmed, and the Chancellery has approved use of force to dispel protestors. You’re authorized to deploy your garrison.”\n\n “Jawohl, thank you.” Getting up, he gathered all his staff officers, NCOs, and directed them to set an alert to move.\n\nWithin five minutes, a force of seventy BGS officers and enlisted personnel had assembled in a convoy of armored vehicles and jeeps, armed with light weapons and tear gas launchers. It was time.\n\nAs the force came down the Kaufingerstrasse, lights flashing and sirens blaring, Strasse signaled for a stop, with the vehicles forming to block the road. Taking out a megaphone, he yelled to the crowd, “The Federal Republic of Germany has declared this an unlawful assembly. Please stand clear of BGS vehicles and clear the area. If not, you will face prosecution and possible use of force. Thank you.”\n\nWhile he was talking, Strasse’s men had donned riot gear, shields, and were forming a line in front of the vehicles, preparing to use tear gas if necessary. However, the crowd was indignant, and attempted to press forward, much to their chagrin. Strasse ordered tear gas to be fired, and they began grappling with the protestors, some of whom were carrying rosaries and Bibles, along with the occasional Catholic priest.\n\nStrasse hated to have to do this, but he had his orders."
 Ollenhauer53.10.d:0 "Yet another cabinet meeting was raging this morning, this time on how to conduct the new Ollenhauer government’s foreign policy. Being somewhat divided between Ollenhauer’s SPD deputies and Franke’s Kanalarbeiter deputies, this debate would be rough, just like it was when Schumacher was Chancellor, thought Ollenhauer. He began.\n\n “Gentlemen, I advocate that we should continue our neutral foreign policy agenda, steering ourselves away from both blocs.” This prompted nods from his allies, and frowns from Franke’s deputies, who began to speak up.\n\n “Herr Chancellor, it is clear that you won’t accept full Western integration, such as policies that Herr Adenauer and the CDU have proposed. But what if we oriented our foreign policy towards the West, but on our government’s terms? Enter into negotiations, with policies that only benefit us.”\n\nOllenhauer nodded. “Interesting, what do you mean?”\n\n “Well sir, entering into security agreements with the US, joining the IMF, setting up friendly relations with other countries.”\n\n “Interesting, interesting. Do we have any ideas for a neutral foreign policy?”\n\nA junior minister spoke up. “Well, sir, we would begin by holding a conference on neutrality here in Germany, perhaps visiting East Berlin, and looking to set up friendly relations with Nordic countries.”\n\nOllenhauer nodded. “Very well. Whatever this policy is, we should call it the Ollenhauer Doctrine, whether we should...”"
 Ollenhauer53.11.d:0 "FROM: Chancellor Erich Ollenhauer, Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\nTO: President [USA.GetLeader], Government of the United States of America; Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader], Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Prime Minister [FRA.GetLeader], Government of the French Republic\n\nSubject: Nuclear Weapons in the Federal Republic\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am writing to inform you that the Bundestag has passed a resolution banning the deployment of nuclear weapons on territory of the Federal Republic. We will be enforcing this within seventy-two (72) hours of your receipt of this note.\n\nWhile we know the strategic value that the Federal Republic plays in the Cold War, we have no interest in becoming a hosting point for weapons of mass destruction."
 Ollenhauer53.12.d:0 "It was a controversial decision, but Ollenhauer’s staff had let him go on with it, even to the chagrin of his security detail. Steube had considered his idea of visiting East Berlin as a show of good faith to be useless and inane, but as they stepped off the plane at Berlin Schoenefeld Airport, he knew it was coming to a reality.\n\nGreeted by only a car, he and his small staff were whisked to the Brandenburg Gate, where First Secretary [DDR.GetLeader] was, accompanied by a small staff, as well as dark-suited Stasi men lining the outside. Ollenhauer, shaking hands, smiled and talked for a few minutes, sharing niceties, before the two of them walked around the square, pointing out sights, both in West Berlin and East Berlin, talking about the city, the war, the culture, governing, and the rest.\n\nSteube smiled. This was totally off the record, for now, and if questioned, the Chancellery would deny ever having been here, at least to quell any CDU opposition that the government was cavorting with communists. He was glad to see that this was working. In his eyes, and Ollenhauer’s, detente with the East via neutral means may work out in the end, assuming they didn’t get any flak for this."
 Ollenhauer53.13.d:0 "Yet another of Ollenhauer’s foreign policy goals was coming to fruition this week with the beginning of the Frankfurt Conference on Neutrality. Suggested by a number of junior SPD deputies as a way of gauging international interest in a neutrality movement, particularly in the European sphere. Invitations had been sent out to the leaders of Sweden, Finland, Austria, Yugoslavia, and Ireland; and nearly all had arrived in Frankfurt, to much fanfare from the hosting West Germans.\n\nIn the Frankfurter Hof, the best hotel in the city, Ollenhauer rose to give the introductory speech to the assembled dignitaries and delegates. “On behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, I welcome all of you to our shining capital of Frankfurt and the Conference on Neutrality! It has been a dream of ours to unite all European countries engaged in neutrality into one space, to discuss the benefits of neutrality, the future of it, and more. I hope that these discussions are fruitful and that we can engage in constructive dialogue towards peace in Europe, outside of the two major blocs. Thank you.”\n\nWalking off in a trail of applause, Ollenhauer was impressed, and sitting down at the seat marked “Federal Republic of Germany,” he was ready to begin this for real."
 Ollenhauer53.14.d:0 "After months of negotiations, Ollenhauer was happy to board his official plane, a Douglas DC-3 whose tail was painted with the colors of the German flag, to journey to Stockholm and Helsinki to sign security agreements with Sweden and Finland.\n\nLanding in Stockholm for the first stop of the tour, Ollenhauer was greeted by the Royal Swedish Army Band and warmly received by Prime Minister [SWE.GetLeader], who held a meeting where the two discussed neutrality arrangements, afterwards they signed the Swedish-German Security Agreement and had a brief lunch.\n\nWith that concluded, Ollenhauer bid farewell to the Swedish Prime Minister, boarding the aircraft again for a short flight to Helsinki, where a similar meeting would take place. Done under more secretive circumstances, having to evade Soviet air defenses and other detection equipment, Ollenhauer’s plane landed in Helsinki under the cover of darkness, a small fleet of cars positioned to receive him without a band or fanfare.\n\nBeing less cordial than in Stockholm, Ollenhauer was nervous, but met Prime Minister [FIN.GetLeader] with warmth, sitting down to a rather informal state dinner where the two discussed their lives and families, as well as the strategic position of Finland in the Nordics, sharing a border with the USSR. Afterwards, the official texts of the Finnish-German Security Agreement were brought out, and with no press briefing, the two affixed their signatures to it, before shaking hands and smiling.\n\nBeing quite tired after this whirlwind tour, Ollenhauer was rather pleased to board the DC-3 back to Frankfurt, happy that he’d accomplished a large part of his master plan for a European neutrality alliance."
 Ollenhauer57.1.d:0 "It was a sunny day in one of the Chancellery’s large meeting rooms that a medium-size crowd of people gathered. Composed of all kinds of people; diplomatic officials, scientific experts, lawyers, press figures, cameramen all clapped as Chancellor Erich Ollenhauer strode to the podium, emblazoned with a giant German eagle, flanked by two flags.\n\n “Good morning, everyone. In the past 8 years since its founding, this country has been through a lot; both domestic and international turmoil. Forced to pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, the Federal Republic has succeeded and re-advanced itself on the world stage.” He paused for applause from the crowd.\n\n “Recent developments in the world have shown us the true power of modern science, in the splitting of the atom, for peace or for war. I, as Chancellor, am pleased to announce the founding of the Federal Republic’s new nuclear power program, named the Deutsche-Atomkraftprogramm. It should be clarified that this program is for peaceful use only; by the War Weapons Control Act, the Federal Republic will not produce nuclear weapons of any form, but will use nuclear technology for power and scientific uses. We applaud support from the United States in this endeavor and look forward to discussing details of this with Ambassador Bruce. Thank you all.”\n\nHe nodded at the US ambassador, standing there somewhat shocked, as the crowd clapped, reporters clamored, and flashbulbs went off, before Ollenhauer walked off into an antechamber, washed with relief after that announcement."
 Ollenhauer57.2.d:0 "As Ollenhauer and his staff rode down the autobahn towards one of West Germany’s newest nuclear power plants, Erich stared out the window, noticing the sun shining. It was Schumacher smiling from above, proud of what his protege had accomplished, and wishing him well on the new power plant groundbreaking. Pulling past the gate and right up next to the administration building, the only building present, Ollenhauer was nervous, particularly as he was swarmed once again by press personnel. Smiling as always, Ollenhauer greeted the press, saying a few words, before walking over to the front of the administration building to shake hands and chat with the plant’s construction foreman, a short, stout Bavarian.\n\nQuickly armed with a shovel, he and the foreman posed for pictures, smiling, before scooping a few shovelfuls of dirt, marking the ceremonial beginning of construction of the Schumacher National Nuclear Power Plant.\n\n “The late Chancellor Kurt Schumacher was truly a great man, a force of nature, and the face of the Social Democratic Party. He would have loved the expansion of nuclear power in the Federal Republic, and because of this, I dedicate this nuclear power plant as the Schumacher National Nuclear Power Plant in his honor. Glory be to Germany!”\n\nApplause reigned as Ollenhauer smiled, taking off his ceremonial hard hat and seeing flashbulbs yet again, before stepping into his black Mercedes, another victory for the public secured."
 Ollenhauer57.3.d:0 "Standing before the Bundestag once again, after the successful 1957 election, Ollenhauer was proud. Less nervous than he had been four years prior, he cleared his throat and began to speak once again.\n\n “Assembled members of the Bundestag; it has been quite a long time since I stood up here on this stage and spoke in front of you all; and in that time, this government has done quite a bit for the benefit of all the citizens of the Federal Republic. In the past few years, we have rejuvenated our border and internal security services, expanded upon cooperation with our colleagues in the Christian Democratic Party and our colleagues in the Kanalarbeiters faction of the Social Democratic Party; and we have reworked the Federal Republic’s foreign policy to be more open-facing and accepting to the world. All of this has been done for one purpose and one purpose alone: for the benefit, safety, security and well-being of every citizen of the Federal Republic, this great nation, no matter their race, sex, religion or creed. Since the election earlier this year, I have remained committed to continuing my agenda, including improving the military further and expanding our foreign policy into a new and hopeful direction. I am excited to see what the future holds for our Republic and the world. Thank you all.”\n\nAmid a chorus of applause, yells of support from both sides, Erich walked away from the podium, chest swelled in accomplishment. This term would be even better than the last."
 Ollenhauer57.4.d:0 "Around the same time every year, the Bundestag was faced with the terrible task of budget appropriations, and this year, it was faced with a new challenge: possibly receiving American military aid to assist the new Bundeswehr. While having a Social Democratic majority, the Bundestag is still somewhat split. The CDU, as usual, made a statement of “request American aid but expand the defense budget as well” and was in support of making cuts to social welfare programs laid out by the SPD. The SPD, split as usual between Franke’s Kanalarbeiter faction and Ollenhauer’s traditionalist faction, is generally against American aid, making the argument that defense expenditures are enough as is and current policy will not require any more, as well as a sudden chill in relations with the United States. However, the proposed aid request is generally small compared to larger packages put forward by Bundeswehr and CDU officials, one that may be amenable to members of both SPD factions. Will the Bundeswehr get its funding?"
 Ollenhauer57.5.d:0 "In line with the debate on American aid, the Bundestag was also debating another issue affecting the new Bundeswehr: whether to continue mandatory conscription of 18-year-olds, or to begin phasing out the policy.\n\nThe CDU, heavily in opposition to this, gave an opening statement, with one member saying “Why phase conscription out just as we are improving and growing our army? This seems very hypocritical from the SPD government, who has acceded to our demands for a strong military and defense but yet wants to weaken our Bundeswehr by not allowing conscription?”\n\nEliciting rage from the left side of the room, who angrily booed, a Kanalarbeiter member stood up, trying to make peace. “Members on both sides. I believe that for the moment, conscription should continue as normal, and should perhaps be expanded to meet the demands of our growing army. However, the foreign policy position of the Ollenhauer government has stressed territorial defense above all else and therefore, conscription should be somewhat limited to only fulfill that goal.”\n\nThis elicited a little more support than the loud CDU member, who was sitting, fuming in his seat. The speaker of the chamber stood up, signaling that now was the time for a vote. What is the fate of conscription in West Germany?"
 Ollenhauer57.6.d:0 "Today was an important day, one that would fundamentally change the nature of Europe at large. In Munich, the preparations had taken months, and the protocol officers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had spent long days and nights setting up meeting rooms for each of the conference committees in the Munich Residenz, the former royal palace of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria.\n\nCentral highways and roads leading to the Residenz were shut down by Bundesgrenzschutz troops as the motorcades came roaring through, fresh off their flights from Munich-Riem Airport. Arriving at the entrance to the massive Residenz, each leader was formally welcomed by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as an escort and salute by BGS troopers.\n\nInside, Ollenhauer sat in the large conference room reserved for heads of state, surrounded by aides and protocol officers, nervous, as the first heads of state arrived. In came the Austrian Chancellor, [AUS.GetLeader]. Shaking hands with them, Ollenhauer was glad to speak in German, having a shared language.\n\nAfter about a half hour, the other remaining leaders arrived, with their large contingents. Being the host and chair of the Conference, Ollenhauer rose to speak, pausing for applause.\n\n “My fellow leaders, I am so glad that you made it. Over these next few days, I hope that we will be able to change the future of Europe, for the good of all our citizens. All of our countries have one goal in mind that we can come together on; neutrality; and dissatisfaction with the status quo of the two-power “cold war” that is unfolding rapidly among us. Our governments can do something about it, so let’s get to work, gentlemen.”\n\nApplause reigned as all of the state leaders present received files from their aides and officers, and steeled themselves for policy work and negotiation."
 Ollenhauer57.7.d:0 "After days of strenuous negotiations, it was time to finalize what all of the Conference attendees had been waiting for, but especially Chancellor Ollenhauer. Meetings with parliamentary leaders, trade experts, and military officials had gone extremely successfully, and as the delegations, led by their heads of state, processed into the large conference room in the Residenz, saluted by BGS troopers and hearing their national anthems being played, Ollenhauer smiled. His dream had come true, finally. As the leaders sat down at the wide table, copies of the ENTO Charter in front of them, cameras flashed, and Ollenhauer rose.\n\n “My distinguished friends and colleagues; I am finally proud to call you allies. With the signing of this Charter, we will found a new organization, one committed to European peace and security for all, and one independent of the superpowers, or nuclear brinkmanship. This is a truly historic moment, one that all peoples of the world should remember. Now, let us found this organization.”\n\n “Applause from all corners of the room echoed as Ollenhauer sat down, smiling and nodding at the other leaders as they picked up their pens, affixing their names to the copies, then passing it to the others, flashbulbs popped. Already, military officials were huddling together, discussing logistics, as the European Neutrality Treaty Organization is born."
 Ollenhauer57.8.d:0 "All Parties to this Treaty,\n\nAffirming their faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments;\n\nDetermined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law\n\nSeeking to promote stability and well-being in the Scandinavian and Central European areas, hereby enter into this agreement;\n\nArticle 1. The Parties will form the European Neutrality Treaty Organization, with headquarters in Munich, Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nArticle 2. In order to defend against incursions by foreign states, the Parties will maintain and develop their individual and collective capability to resist all forms of armed attack.\n\nArticle 3. In the event of any armed attack on any Party, the Organization will exercise the right of collective self-defense under the provisions of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and will consider any attack an attack on all Parties.\n\nArticle 4. Provisions of Article 3 apply to land territory of the Parties, as well as territorial waters and territorial airspace.\n\nArticle 5. The Parties hereby establish a Council (hereafter known as the “ENTO Council”) to consider administrative, financial, economic, and logistical aspects of Members participating in the Organization; as well as creating any subsidiary bodies, such as a Defense Committee and any other bodies the Council deems fit.\n\nArticle 6. Any European State may be admitted to the Organization, provided that they are not a member of any other Security Organization, express a desire to be neutral and non-aligned, and successfully accede to the provisions of this Charter.\n\nArticle 7. This Charter shall be ratified and its provisions carried out by the Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will inform each of the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.\n\nSIGNED, IN MUNICH,\n\nErich Ollenhauer, Federal Chancellor, Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\n[FIN.GetLeader], Prime Minister, Government of Finland\n[SWE.GetLeader], Prime Minister, Government of Sweden\n[YUG.GetLeader], Prime Minister, Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"
 Ollenhauer57.9.d:0 "With the signing of the ENTO Charter in Munich only days ago, the world quite literally blew its lid. Diplomacy has been changed in an instant as the entire nature of the Cold War, particularly in the European security environment, has changed, with lines being redrawn.\n\nIn the United States today, President [USA.GetLeader] was woken up from a dead sleep to this news, cursing to his aides and advisors in rage, with yells of “the damn Germans have done it again!” being heard throughout the White House. While the US federal government has not made an official comment, it is not expected to be good, particularly as Chancellor Ollenhauer has soured relations with the West diplomatically.\n\nIn the East, Soviet General Secretary [SOV.GetLeader] is similarly upset, prompting immediate condemnation from the Soviet Politburo, and understandably, similar responses from other countries in the Eastern Bloc.\n\nIt appears that a wedge has been driven between the East and the West in Europe, and the geopolitical world has been forever changed."

 Franke53.1.d:0 "As the assembled Bundestag murmured among themselves in the large chambers, Franke stepped in, taking the podium; putting on a pair of glasses; clearing his throat.\n\n “Assembled members of the Bundestag; I am here, as usual, to report on the status of the Federal Republic and to outline my agenda for the next year. We have accomplished much this year, and this government has been through quite a lot. With the passing of former Chancellor Schumacher, the country was thrown into chaos once again. The party had its challenges from that, but ultimately, I was chosen as Chancellor.”\n\nThe last sentence caused a little bit of noise in the room, as some quietly stated their objections to Franke, but he continued to keep talking.\n\n “It is critical that we weather through this stormy time as a united nation. While the SPD has experienced some internal issues, it is essential that we maintain friendly relations in order to maintain a majority. We remain oriented towards Western policy, and to the credit of the CDU members before me, we recognize the fundamental threat that the Soviet Union presents to our great nation. I pledged my sacred honor upon these ideals taking the helm of Chancellor, and this I swear to do for all the people of Germany!”\n\nThis last part elicited applause, from not only the SPD side, but the CDU; even their deputies were impressed.\n\nPundits were pleasantly surprised by the diplomatic tone of Franke, rare after what had happened, and are curious about the future of German SPD relations under the new Chancellor."
 Franke53.2.d:0 "It was a sunny day in the Chancellor's cabinet room as Franke began their daily meetings with a new announcement. After days and days of meetings about the economy and political relations both within the SPD and with the CDU, they had never discussed what foreign policy would be proposed. Franke began, motioning his ministers to sit down as he began to talk.\n\n “Gentlemen, while we’ve talked about nearly every other aspect of our government’s policies, we have not discussed one crucial topic: foreign policy. To lead us off, I’ll now move for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to speak on our progress on some preliminary policy ideas.”\n\nSitting down, the Minister for Foreign Affairs rose rather sheepishly, facing the cabinet of relatively new ministers, from both factions of the SPD.\n\n “Well, Chancellor, we find it is in the best interest of West Germany to pursue limited Western integration in this period.”\n\nFrom around the room, gasps, most of surprise and anger, emerged from the reformist SPD ministers appointed as a diplomatic gesture by Franke. Some tried to pipe up to begin a discussion but were silenced by their colleagues to let the Minister continue.\n\n “Ahem. Anyway, we believe it is in the best interest to begin slow Western integration- nothing like our colleagues in the CDU have proposed, but a gradual turn to the West to begin receiving more assistance. As well, we should stress more friendly ties with the East Germans, particularly surrounding Berlin and opening access between the two nations.”\n\nFranke looked up, seeing the rather painful conversations going on between both reformist and conservative factions of his SPD cabinet.\n\n “Gentlemen.” He rapped on the table. “While these proposals may seem controversial, they were designed with both policy goals of each SPD faction in mind. We understand the need for cooperation and common-sense policy-making and this is the best option at the moment.” With that, there was some applause, as the negotiations to what specific policy would be would start, soon enough."
 Franke53.3.d:0 "Franke was in his office, reading morning reports as his Minister for Foreign Affairs came bursting in, with a few senior aides and his Chief of Staff. He knew what this was about. “Chancellor, there’s been an update to the Hungarian crisis developing.”\n\n “Tell me what you have.”\n\n “Well, sir, the Soviet Army has intervened in the ensuing crisis. While they already had troops in Hungary prior to the revolt, additional divisions have appeared in Budapest and surrounding areas, according to our intelligence. Hundreds of thousands of dissident Hungarians are fleeing into neighboring, neutral Austria. There are expected to be hundreds of deaths from the ensuing Soviet occupation and installation of a pro-Moscow government.”\n\n “Mein Gott. What possibly can we do?”\n\n “Well sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has suggested that we reach out to the Austrians and offer assistance in processing refugees and displaced persons, allowing them to get to the West.”\n\n “What do the others think about this? Would this garner public support?”\n\nHis Chief of Staff broke in. “Yes, Herr Chancellor. It appears that the German public would mobilize some sort of relief effort for the refugees whether we do it or not. I may be wrong, but I assume the three Western powers would be in support as well.” The Minister of Foreign Affairs broke back in. “Yes. No matter what we do - whether we do a refugee effort or simply issue a condemnation, we would have support. It’s only up to you how far we go.”"
 Franke53.4.d:0 "Today was no normal meeting of the Chancellor’s Cabinet. A situation had developed in the Middle East, and Chancellor Franke felt that it warranted a response.\n\nHe opened. “Herr Minister, what does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs know?”\n\n“Mr. Chancellor, as you know, Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal on July 26. It’s been just over three months now, and we have been informed that those two countries have deployed paratroopers to seize the Suez Canal.”\n\nThis prompted a flurry of conversation from around the cabinet table.\n\nFranke spoke above them. “We must make a decision; whether to honor our friendship with Britain and France; or to speak out in support of Nasser, offering diplomatic support.”\n\nThe Minister spoke again. “Going against the Allies, especially the French, may not be wise right now. We are still trying to consolidate our position on the world stage. However, pledging support for the United Nations effort currently may prove as a neutral position; supporting Nasser by default, without directly intervening.”\n\nFranke considered the options, then placed the matter up to a vote of the Cabinet. What will our position be?"
 Franke53.5.d:0 "About to stand in front of the world, Franke was nervous, as he should be. There was a lot to prove to them, and after all that had happened in Europe in the past 20 years, he was expecting a lot of hostility. It was time, as the UN Chief of Protocol appeared to introduce him.\n\n “Ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Egon Franke!” Applause rang out as Franke climbed the steps and approached the podium, adorned with a golden UN crest.\n\n “Thank you all very much. I am honored to be here today in New York to address the United Nations General Assembly at its 11th session this year. This has been the first time in the United Nations’ history where a West German representative has addressed the Assembly. I am proud to be that representative, and am proud of the progress that Germany has made in this rapidly emerging “Cold War.” We have successfully pulled ourselves up from the bootstraps and re-developed our economy, taken Germany on a new social democratic path, and asserted our foreign policy on the world stage, as I speak right here. I beg, plead to the larger powers of the world, the Security Council, to rethink your policies; catching countries such as Germany in the middle of your large ideological conflicts is alienating and not helpful. I thank the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, and all those assembled for letting me speak. Danke.”\n\nApplause reigned once again as Franke walked off the stage, receiving nods and smiles from not only the West German delegation but many delegations from around the world."
 Franke53.6.d:0 "FROM: Federal Ministry of Finance; Federal Ministry of Labor; Federal Ministry for Economy\nTO: Office of the Chancellery\nSUBJECT: Godesberg Program Proposal\n\nHerr Chancellor; Attached are our cross-ministerial recommendations for the government’s new economic program, known as the ‘Godesberg Program’.\n\n1. Immediate appointment of Karl Schiller, current minister for economy in Hamburg, for Federal Minister of Economics.\n\n2. Nationalization of Volkswagen GmbH and expansion of automobile production\n\n3. Development and expansion of oil refining facilities and rail networks in Bavaria\n\n4. Expansion of social reforms, including national health insurance, an expanded hospital system, and integration of unions and trade organizations into the policymaking process.\n\n5. If applicable, a harsher separation of Kanalarbeiter policies from Traditionalist SPD policies, including condemning neo-leftist policies and all forms of communism.\n\nWe believe that these five points will revitalize Germany while maintaining a social democratic character to the government."
 Franke53.7.d:0 "FROM: Bundespolizei, Federal Ministry of the Interior; Bundesgrenzschutz Command (BGSK)\nTO: Office of the Chancellery\nSUBJECT: Operation RED SCARE\n\nHerr Chancellor;\n\nRecent security reports, particularly of behavior within the Social Democratic Party, have revealed worrying signs of particular members of the party. Members of the Traditionalist faction of the party led by Erich Ollenhauer have exhibited actions consistent with neo-leftists and have conducted trips to East Berlin to meet with East German SED communist leaders.\n\nThe Bundespolizei and BGS has proposed a few ideas in order to combat or mitigate these possible threats.\n\n1. Begin passive surveillance of Ollenhauer and other leading Traditionalist members, including their offices, residences, and travel movements.\n\n2. Mandate all SPD members report their movements out of the country, and passively increase security checks at high-traffic areas on the inner-German border and within West Berlin.\n\n3. Conduct anti-surveillance operations within all SPD offices, as well as the Federal Chancellery and Bundestag chambers.\n\nThese points will ensure the domestic security of West Germany and prevent Communist infiltration of the SPD and the West German government."
 Franke53.8.d:0 "It was a sunny day as Franke’s motorcade pulled into the headquarters of Lowenbrau Brewery in Munich, where a PR event was due to take place. Part of the overall Godesberg Program suggested by the Ministers of Labor, Finance, and Economy; this event was meant to highlight the appeal of Bavarian beer and expand its production to beyond German markets.\n\nSmiling happily and posing with a stein of beer next to the Lowenbrau plant manager and marketing executives, this ad will be displayed throughout Europe and the US, in the hopes of expanding Lowenbrau and other Bavarian beer companies’ reaches over international markets, and a better economic future for Germany."

 Franke57.1.d:0 "It was early in the morning in the Chancellery, early enough that only the essential staff should be there. The sun was coming up; it was barely dawn, but in the Chancellor’s office stood five individuals: Chancellor Franke, his Chief of Staff, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Nuclear Affairs. The latter being a new position created by Franke in his previous term, this meeting would have world-altering importance. The Minister of Defense, the CSU opposition choice of Franz Josef Strauss, led off.\n\n “Well, as some of us have talked about, I think we can all agree that the current world situation merits a greater defense capability. While we have already made our decision regarding the Bundeswehr and Bundesgrenzschutz, there is an added aspect which we should consider.” Nodding at Franke, he continued. “It is my opinion that this government should begin a small, limited, self-defensive nuclear weapons program.”\n\nThe Minister for Nuclear Affairs, another CDU member, Siegfried Balke, nodded. “Yes. With our current nuclear power capability, and with additional assistance from the Americans or the French, we can begin enriching uranium for weapons use.”\n\nFranke nodded. “Excellent.” Looking over to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who looked rather concerned, he motioned for him to speak.\n\n “This may cause more problems than benefits. Convincing the Americans that we do not need to use their own nuclear weapons, dealing with the Soviets who may see this as a massive escalation, my office will need to deal with the public reaction.”\n\nFranke nodded, grimly. “Well, we’ll have to deal with this the best we can. Contact the Americans, let’s enter negotiations, and hold off the Soviets for now, hence they find out. Let’s move.”"
 Franke57.2.d:0 "FROM: Federal Ministry of Nuclear Affairs\nTO: Office of the Chancellery\nSUBJECT: Report of American AEC Advisors’ Visit\n\nChancellor,\n\nOne week ago, officials of the Ministry received a visit from five members and aides from the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) regarding US-German cooperation in the field of defensive nuclear weapons.\n\nComing off of initially cool and harsh reception from the US Embassy in Frankfurt, the visit of AEC officials and their meetings with BMAt officials furthered cooperation, particularly on specific details such as uranium enrichment and methods of converting current nuclear facilities into enrichment facilities, and particular procedures for that process.\n\nContact with our liaison in the Ministry of Defense has indicated that similar meetings with American DoD officials and USAFE staff in Brussels have gone well, particularly in discussions surrounding the German nuclear weapons proliferation strategy and logistics of how they might be deployed.\n\nVisiting several nuclear power plants around the country, the AEC advisors will likely set up a more permanent presence out of the embassy in Frankfurt, as negotiations and meetings of policy continue, as the program begins."
 Franke57.3.d:0 "FROM: Federal Agency for Technical Relief (Bundesanstalt Technisches Hilfswerk, THW)\nTO: Office of the Chancellery\n\nSUBJECT: Report of the Federal Nuclear Readiness Test\n\nChancellor,\n\nApproximately one month ago, a nation-wide nuclear readiness test was conducted for the entire West German population. Established by order of this agency and coordinated with all state and municipal governments, the exercise concluded with an estimated 85% participation rate among the population.\n\nThe purpose of such a test was to simultaneously train the population on precautions to take in case of a nuclear conflict, and to gather crucial data and statistics on a national response to a nuclear conflict.\n\nThe exercise began in the early hours of the morning, when upon receiving a radar alert, air raid sirens around the country began going off, signaling THW personnel to begin organizing the public to make their way to fallout shelters and other organizing locations.\n\nApproximately 18 minutes later, Bundesgrenzschutz and Ministry of Defense Headquarters confirmed the “destruction” of Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne, Munich, and other major German cities by Soviet nuclear bombs.\n\nAfter a period of counting and determining scope of “destruction”, officials at the THW and their regional organizations have confirmed that of the population taking part in the exercise, approximately 30%, or around 13 million individuals, were “killed” as a result of the detonation or resulting destruction. It is the opinion of the THW that more could be done to save the population in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack."

 Franke57.5.d:0 "Standing in the shadows of the UN Security Council chamber, Franke looked ever more nervous. Flanked by his Chief of Staff, Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Nuclear Affairs, Franke took a seat at the desk provided for observing members of the Council, and mentally prepared himself to speak. After all this time, many hours and long nights of discussions with his ministers, diplomats, and scientists, it had all come to this. What would they think? His Minister for Foreign Affairs had prepared a preliminary estimate of reactions, but Franke could never be sure.\n\nThe President of the Security Council, US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., stood up, bringing the meeting to order, before allowing Franke to speak.\n\n “Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Security Council. I understand the reason why I am here is controversial as I’m sure all of you have heard. Four of the five permanent members of this Council are nuclear-armed states, for one reason or another. Possession of nuclear weapons and technology is a serious topic and issue in our time, particularly with the tensions between some members of this Council. The Government of the Federal Republic has recognized this and has moved forward with plans for nuclear power and/or limited nuclear weapons. We should stress that whether for peace or war, our possession of nuclear technology is being handled in accordance with negotiations from allies and other responsible states alike. We recognize the issues and unfortunate past inherent in Germany’s history with nuclear development and are attempting to remedy that as best we can. I can only hope that the countries of the Security Council and the United Nations at large will accept our endeavors and respect our decision to become a nuclear power.”\n\nThere were no claps, and as Franke sat down, he could feel the Soviet Ambassador’s angry glare on his face.\n\nThe meeting carried on, with the Soviet Ambassador delivering a sharp attack concerning “fascists and imperialists with nuclear weapons,” which soon devolved into an ideological battle with the other four members. For Franke, however, this appeared to be some success."
 Franke57.6.d:0 "It was an early afternoon in the Chancellery when Franke, busy mulling over more reports in his office, received a knock on the door, with his friend and Kanalarbeiter member, Karl Herold, bursting in. Herold looked rather hurried and angry, huffing as he walked in.\n\n “Egon, this is deplorable. You MUST do something about this!”\n\n “Good to see you again, Karl. I take it the Bundestag is doing well?”\n\n “Well, Chancellor, I wish I could say so. No problems with our lawmaking and your policies at all, but it's the cafeteria that’s the issue here.”\n\n “What is it, Karl?”\n\n “Well, Egon, it’s the cafeteria. There’s no food. The portions are too small. We have to bring in sausages from home! This is insane!”\n\nFranke sighed. Standing up, he took Herold by the shoulder and walked him out of the office. Ten minutes later, they were in the Bundestag building’s cafeteria, sitting down with the head manager.\n\n “You must be wondering why I’m here, Herr Strass. I’ve been told that the food portions here in the cafeteria are steadily decreasing.”\n\nHe was shaking in his boots, not ordinarily used to speaking to a high-ranking person such as Franke. “Yes, sir, I guess they are.”\n\n “Well, then, how can we fix this? The Bundestag members here need to eat well if they can accomplish their mission of serving this country.”\n\n “Well sir, we’ll try harder to fix that.”\n\n “Thank you, Herr Strass. Have a good day.” He winked at Herold, shaking the manager’s hand, as they waltzed out, another problem of the Federal Republic solved."
 Franke57.7.d:0 "After days and days of deliberation and planning, it was time. Franke’s Chief of Staff immediately knew what was happening when he opened the door to the Chancellor’s office.\n\nFive minutes later, the calls had been made, and escorted by Bundespolizei and BGS officers, Erich Ollenhauer was rather unceremoniously marched into Franke’s office, where SPD officials as well as officials from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) waited, as well as Franke himself.\n\nOllenhauer was a mixture of furious, confused, and somehow, aware of what would happen. While the police waited outside, the discussions began.\n\n “I’m sure you know why you’re here, Erich.”\n “No, Chancellor, I really don’t. I’d like an explanation as to why police officers were outside my office to collect me.”\n “That was regrettable, but we had to make sure you would come here regardless.”\n “Well what of it? I’m here now.”\n\n “Herr Ollenhauer, your actions over the last few months and years have raised suspicion, particularly that of our domestic intelligence and security services, as well as party officials. That’s why all these people are here. Your movements, particularly two visits to East Berlin within the last year, as well as visits to Yugoslavia, as an official member of this government without permission have produced much concern in this office. Therefore, in my capacity as Federal Chancellor and Leader of the Social Democratic Party, I am terminating your service from this government as well as your membership in the Social Democratic Party. Your position in the Bundestag will be retained on an independent non-affiliated basis until the next election.”\n\n “What? Egon, why? Those visits to Berlin- they were of a diplomatic nature, I meant nothing damaging to the security of this Republic by engaging in talks with East German representatives.” Looking over at the SPD officials, he pleaded, “Surely this cannot be legal. The Chancellor cannot make such a decision unilaterally?”\n\nOne of the officials came forward. “I’m afraid it is, Herr Ollenhauer. The bylaws state he can remove your membership and fire you from the government; as said before, your position in the Bundestag will not be affected for the time being.”\n\nOllenhauer sighed, sinking what felt like a foot into the carpet. “Very well. Rest assured this government and this party will not lose sight of my mission, and my ideals. You will face this challenge in court, but I will go.”\n\nWalking out of the room, all collected seemed depressed, as if they didn’t want to do this; especially Franke, but he had to."
 Franke57.8.d:0 "“FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) - Reports from senior staffers within the West German Federal Chancellery indicate the formation today of the “United Bloc” - a partnership between the ruling Social Democratic Party and the minority Christian Democratic Union. Composed mostly of conservative elements within the SPD, led by Chancellor Egon Franke, this so-called “grand coalition” or “red-yellow coalition” was not entirely unexpected by most political analysts, who assumed the two factions would come together. Largely sidelining the left-wing reformist faction led by Erich Ollenhauer in the SPD, this new coalition is expected to garner much more interest for future West German politics.”\n\nReading this clipping the next morning, Franke was rather pleased with how it came out. Picking up the phone, he dialed the office of the CDU headquarters.\n\n “Konrad, have you seen this morning’s paper yet?”"
 Franke57.9.d:0 "As usual, the Bundestag was buzzing, but for a different reason. Instead of debating laws and spending, they were debating something different; what socialism meant. It was largely a debate between the CDU and the SPD and its both factions about what it meant, and like every partisan issue, was wildly going out of control.\n\nWhile the CDU delegates went on and on, conflating socialism with communism, the SPD delegates booed, yelled back anti-Nazi phrases, and tried to argue, all while the parliamentarian attempted to restore order.\n\nNo one was entirely sure why this was being done, just that one of Franke’s deputies had put it on the docket, hoping that the Federal Republic could provide a political definition of socialism. The SPD deputies, in earnest, were trying to defend it, arguing that socialism was the best form of government for Germany, and that nationalizing industry would work eventually. However, a decision had to be made, and soon."
 Franke57.10.d:0 "“Why must we let personal beliefs be taught in the public classroom?”\n\nThis, punctuating yet another productive day in the Bundestag, centered on a new, controversial issue which had also been sweeping neighboring Belgium: the teaching of religious education, particularly Catholic theology, in public, government-funded schools.\n\nObviously, the opposition Christian Democratic Union is in full support of religious education and prayer in schools, particularly towards a designated time during the day for mandated worship. The ruling Social Democratic Party would ordinarily be wholeheartedly opposed to this plan on secular, social democratic grounds, if not for some Kanalarbeiter deputies remaining generally moderate on the issue. While most agree that the use of government funds towards prayer in schools is an inherent negative, some are not opposed to the idea of a prayer time or other allowances for Catholic and Protestant beliefs to be introduced into school curriculum on a voluntary basis.\n\nHowever, this is further alienating them from the Traditionalist wing of the SPD, who believes that the government and organized religion (mainly in this case the Catholic Church) should have no interaction on an educational level. However, a decision is yet to be made on this issue."
 Franke57.11.d:0 "As a new morning began, a new cabinet meeting was started, with a new, and important topic: NATO. Upon its initial formation in 1949 to defend Western Europe, the Schumacher Government refused membership unilaterally out of anger towards both the Western and the Eastern Blocs. However, the new Franke government, angling more towards a pro-Western policy, has considered a proposal to join NATO.\n\nOne of the Traditionalist SPD delegates rose, beginning to speak anxiously about “the commitment to this Alliance, the men that could die, what are we getting ourselves into?”\n\nFranke’s Chief of Staff started in with a rebuttal, “This country will be overrun by the Soviets whether we join this Alliance or not. If we join, at the very least as a limited member, we will have some protection, at least allied forces will be able to cover our positions, and buy us some chance of survival.”\n\n “Very well then, what does becoming a limited member entail?”\n\nFranke looked over at his military aide and Minister of Foreign Affairs, looking for some sort of answer.\n\n “For now, sir, we can begin the accession process to become a NATO observer, or become a full member. Observers do not guarantee mutual security but the Alliance would most certainly come to our aid based on the understanding that we have certain reservations.”\n\n “Very well then. What shall our decision be?”"
 Franke57.12.d:0 "It is with surprising news from Frankfurt and Brussels jointly today that the Federal Republic of Germany has submitted accession documents to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on an observing basis. Coming as a shock to most observers of European security policy, particularly with the ruling Social Democratic government under Chancellor Egon Franke, a senior government official revealed that the idea was part of an overall pro-Western orientation, and membership will include all benefits other than mutual security guaranteed under Article 5. Proving pleasing to most opposition leaders and Franke’s faction of the SPD, this is not likely to go over well with the Traditionalist faction, particularly with their anti-bloc sentiments."
 Franke57.13.d:0 ""Ladies and gentlemen of the European Economic Community, thank you all for coming here today. I am more than honored to speak in front of this body today to report on Germany’s role in the new, emerging European landscape. The German people have come a long way in less than ten years of existence, and the Social Democratic Governments have steered us towards progress. I believe that in an ever-changing world, one largely defined by ideological and political differences, that the EEC should unite into one force, not only to support our economics, but to support our people, our foreign policies, and our culture. Europe can be more united, and in this progressive time, I feel that now is the time to get much accomplished for the good of the world. Thank you.""
 Franke57.14.d:0 "FROM: Office of the Chancellery\nTO: All Ministries and Agencies\nSUBJECT: New Military and Economic Reforms for the Federal Republic\n\nEffective immediately are new broad initiatives designed to harness the military and economic might of the Federal Republic.\n\n1. Expand the Bundeswehr and/or Bundesgrenzschutz to a larger extent, stressing the need for military officer training.\n\n2. Discuss accepting foreign military aid, particularly from the United States and other Allied nations.\n\n3. Debate the issue of conscription and soldiers/veterans benefits.\n\n4. Continue to expand industrial facilities, including oil refinery plants in Bavaria, and coal production facilities in the Ruhr region.\n\n5. Increase infrastructure, with a particular focus on rail and air networks as opposed to general autobahns and other forms of road transportation.\n\nThese policies serve merely as a foundation for your departments and agencies to work off of, and the Office of the Chancellery looks forward to continued collaboration with each executive ministry, agency, or commission involved.\n\nRegards,\nChancellor Egon Franke"
 Franke57.15.d:0 "Today was to be a momentous day for the people of West Germany. As hundreds of thousands of German families tuned into the nightly news program Tagesschau, they were interrupted by a special report, directly from the Chancellery. This was the first time since television became widely available that the West German federal government had made an address, and, standing in front of a wide podium emblazoned with a black eagle stood Egon Franke, Chancellor, popular among most but not all.\n\n “People of Germany! My fellow Germans! This is the first time that some of you are seeing me live on television, direct from the Federal Chancellery in Frankfurt. Television is one of the most modern and innovative media forms in this emerging century, and I chose this to illustrate how much the Federal Republic has changed in the last decade. Since our founding ten years ago, much has been done. Our government is strong, built for the people and by the people; our economy, prospering; our foreign affairs, developing ties with the West by the day; our military, strong, and continuing to develop into its prime. We Germans have witnessed many events in the past ten years; great-power diplomacy by both the West and the East; wars, internal strife, and issues. But we have persevered! I know the spirit of Germany lives on in every single German, and it will continue to live on into the 1960s! I could not be more proud to be your Federal Chancellor and will continue to do all that I have promised. Thank you very much, Germany, and guten nacht.""

 ENTO.1.d:0 "FROM: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Federal Republic of Germany\nSUBJECT: Entry into ENTO\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany feels that the emerging political landscape in Europe is becoming more and more ideological and alienating by the day. We propose founding a European Neutrality Treaty Organization, or ENTO, to provide a “shield” of neutrality and non-bloc power projection, instead focusing on cooperation and the goodwill of our citizens.\n\nYour country has had a proven track record of neutrality and general non-aggression in the European landscape and therefore, the Federal Republic of Germany, under the authority of the Chancellor, is extending an invitation to accede to this new organization, as soon as possible. Our diplomatic corps eagerly await your reply."
 ENTO.2.d:0 "Our diplomatic corps has reported to the Chancellery that several eligible countries have accepted our offer to join the new European Neutrality Treaty Organization. Now that this is set into stone, we can begin to draft accession and more substantive regulations for membership into ENTO."
 ENTO.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, our diplomatic corps has reported to the Chancellery that some countries have declined our offer to join the new European Neutrality Treaty Organization, perhaps out of security or self-interest. However, we will not despair and continue to press forward - perhaps there will be a time in the future when we can expand our alliance!"

 Reimann.1.d:0 "In a Frankfurt square, Max Reimann rose to a podium, KPD flags and the new German flag behind him. He was internally nervous, but did not show it. While Reimann knew his victory in the election in September was dubious at best, he had to remain strong for his people and the party. The square was crowded enough, mostly with party functionaries as well as opposition activists and other press.\n\n “Good evening comrades! Welcome to a new and prosperous Deutschland for all!\n\n This was met by some cheering, but not raucous; echoing in the square.\n\n “We have emerged victorious in the elections; not by revolution, but by the ballot box!”\n\nThis elicited more cheering than before; Reimann was getting there.\n\n “Marx and Engels, if they were here today, would be proud of our progress, throwing off the shackles of Western imperialism, setting our own path forward, for the German people, instead of dictators or corporate interests!”\n\nMore cheering continued.\n\n “We have taken power at a critical point in our country’s history; having been freed from Nazism while being coerced into casual imperialism against our socialist brothers in the east! Much work will have to be done in this, our new government, our new Federal Republic!”\n\nWith this, the crowd erupted, fully realizing the point of his address. Reimann ended, stepping away from the podium, consulting with his advisors, moving forward."
 Reimann.2.d:0 "“IMPERIALISM!”\n\nThe room echoed, as Reimann slammed his fist on the desk. His ministers and close advisors looked up, some in shock, some not.\n\n “Plain and simple, this “law” was written by bourgeois forces, dictated by the Western occupying powers, rubber-stamped by the Bundestag, and forced on the population without their consent. Now that we have won the elections, with some assistance; we can solve this issue, and make the government more representative of the proletariat and their interests; instead of kneeling to the demands of the conservatives and Western military commanders.”\n\nGenerating applause from the room, Reimann smiled slightly, his anger diminishing for the moment. The government needed to get to work."
 Reimann.3.d:0 "Thirteen men and two women sat in a drab, beige, nearly windowless room, in the Chancellery. Most knew why they were there, but a few seemed lost. All would be made clear when Chancellor Reimann entered the room, flanked by a few aides.\n\n “Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. I’ve gathered you all here today for a crucial purpose: to form a Commission for Constitutional Affairs to solve the problem of the current puppet Basic Law. You all have been selected for your legal and political experience, and your assistance in this matter will be a vital priority to the future of the Federal Republic. Please take your duties seriously. For now, we will begin discussing the basics. As you probably know, the current “Basic Law” is inadequate for our needs, and serves as a form of puppet government for our American and allied overlords to dictate policy for the German people. We need an alternative, and we need one fast.”\n\n “Well, Chancellor, the easiest way to accomplish this without compromising public support would be to make selective amendments to the current Basic Law, and maintaining democratic language.”\n\n “On the other hand, Herr Straub, the better way to go about this would be to completely rewrite the Basic Law into a purely socialist document. This way, there could not be any legal argument for the opposition against our rule, and, although we will alienate parts of the public, it will be necessary to solidify our control.” One of the women responded, from the corner of the room.\n\nMurmurs began as all of the members shifted in their seats, attempting to take one position or another, or make a point.\n\n “Members, members, we can debate the intricacies later, but how should we proceed from here?”"
 Reimann.4.d:0 "TO: Office of the Chancellery\nFROM: Federal Commission for Constitutional Affairs\nSUBJECT: Proposed Amendments to the Basic Law\n\nHerr Chancellor,\n\nBelow are several proposed amendments and edits to the current Basic Law, designed to reflect the new government while retaining democratic consensus and language.\n\n1. Amending the wording of Article 20, to say “The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic, consensus-based socialist state.\n\n2. Remove clause (2) of Article 21, relating to the unconstitutionality of political parties that “seek to impair or abolish the free and democratic basic order”\n\n3. Remove Articles 42-45; which relate to Bundestag powers, including public meetings, investigatory committees, and the appointment of a Standing Committee for Oversight.\n\n4. Remove Articles 50-53, dissolving the Bundesrat, and providing a Presidium or Central Committee composed of all state leaders and chaired by the Chancellor.\n\n5. Remove Articles 66-69 of the Basic Law, relating to powers of the Federal Chancellor, and replace them with language that bans a vote of no confidence and allows the Chancellor to form an emergency government at any time.\n\n6. Amend clause (2) of Article 79 to “shall require the approval of a simple majority of the Bundestag”, removing the two-thirds supermajority.\n\nIt is our hope that these changes will be only the beginning in a package aimed at reforming the Basic Law to reflect the will of the people."
 Reimann.5.d:0 "TO: Office of the Chancellery\nFROM: Federal Commission for Constitutional Affairs\nSUBJECT: Proposal for a New Socialist Constitution\n\nHerr Chancellor,\n\nBelow are several broad proposals for subjects in a new constitution for the Federal Republic.\n\n1. The unalienable socialist rights and principles of the common citizen, including the freedom of speech of socialist principles and the freedom of association, employment, healthcare, and fair pay.\n\n2. Asserting the leadership and wisdom of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in all governmental and party affairs\n\n3. Structuring the government to replace the Federal Cabinet with a Council of Ministers led by the First Secretary of the KPD as well as an executive Council of State, led by a Premier.\n\n4. Replacing the Federal States with Provincial Committees, led by KPD party leaders in those states, who are answerable to the central federal government.\n\n5. Authorizing the development of a military for self-defense from Western forces, including ground, naval, and air forces.\n\n6. Reaffirming close ties with the Soviet Union, all Communist countries, and socialism at large.\n\nThese basic ideas serve to provide a framework for more specific regulations on the functioning and structure of the new state."
 Reimann.6.d:0 "The Federal Commission for Constitutional Affairs was in one of their usual meetings and, after having decided to rewrite the Basic Law entirely into a properly socialist one, became lodged in a bitter debate: what kind of language to use in this new document. Reimann tried to keep the debate civil, but members shouted over each other anyway.\n\n “To appeal to the opposition parties we need to keep some semblance of democratic order-”\n “You fool! Marx would have never allowed bourgeois influence to infiltrate a socialist constitution!”\n “Otherwise this document cannot pass! We must do this right, after all!”\n\nReimann broke back in. “Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. No need to bicker. We need to maintain the sanctity of a socialist state, and take inspiration from our comrades in Russia. However, your point that opposition forces need to be included is also adept, as unfortunate as that may be. Shall we take a vote on how this constitution should be phrased?”"
 Reimann.7.d:0 "In a dimly lit, but large office in the CDU headquarters building in Bonn, Adenauer flipped through his paper and briefing documents. While the KPD government, elected however they were, had tried to clamp down on the West German press, they had not had very much success with a well-established corps of journalists. Many stories and leaks from staffers had managed to make their way through the sieve of censors and government spokesmen.\n\nOn the front page, in large, bold font, screamed the headline “GOVERNMENT PROPOSES NEW CONSTITUTION”.\n\nAdenauer looked at this, before slamming his fist on the desk, prompting an aide and several other CDU officials to come rushing in. “What is the meaning of this?” Adenauer yelled angrily.\n\n “Sir, it appears that they want to write a new socialist constitution, to reflect the new composition of their government-”\n\n “We must deny and condemn this action, boycott it at all costs! The Basic Law cannot be infringed on! These communists-”\n\n “Yes, sir. The Allies are not pleased; in fact, they’re depending on the CDU to galvanize support against it, but that seems somewhat unlikely in the face of their growing support.”\n\n “Do whatever it takes to shut this down, and I mean whatever it takes.”\n\n “Yes, sir.”"
 Reimann.8.d:0 "TO: All Departments and Ministries\nFROM: Office of the Chancellery\nSUBJECT: Federal Bureau for Central Planning\n\nFor All Officials,\n\nEffective immediately, the Federal Bureau for Central Planning will supersede all economic and financial tasks for the Federal Government. The Bureau’s responsibilities are as follows:\n\n1. Assuming administrative control over all state-owned enterprises, current or future-owned, including natural resources, manufacturing, and infrastructure.\n\n2. Coordinating country-wide Five-Year Plans and maintaining efficiency in all aspects of the economy\n\n3. Liaising with other socialist countries to determine the best courses of action with economic planning and industrialization.\n\nThese three suggestions are the basic framework of the Bureau, which is hereby formed under my signature and will begin operations as soon as possible.\n\nSIGNED\nChancellor Max Reimann"
 Reimann.9.d:0 "Reimann’s cabinet meetings were sometimes raucous, while sometimes quiet, with all members agreeing. This morning, gathered with more experts from the Federal Bureau for Central Planning, was an example of the former.\n\n “Why should we accept Western bribes and handouts?” A minister asked, rather incredulously.\n\n “I’m sure Chancellor Reimann would agree with me; we need all the help we can get right now, whether from the East or West. The United States may revoke our funds in the future if we don’t take this offer now, the money may be gone.”\n\nReimann looked over at the man, the deputy chair of the Federal Bureau for Central Planning. “Your argument is sound, and this may be a way that we can appear friendly to the West while receiving funds and using them for central planning and further industrialization to support our socialist mission.”\n\nThe first minister piped back up, “Sir, are you really willing to sacrifice your ideological principles for stacks of cash? You seem no better than the filthy capitalists and imperialists we are fighting against!”\n\nThis caused the room to erupt into chaos, but a decision swiftly had to be made, and fast."
 Reimann.10.d:0 "BONN, West Germany (AP) - Today, Communist Party Chairman and newly elected Federal Chancellor Max Reimann condemned the Allied Occupation Statute as “an imperialist and colonialist puppet document designed to shackle the rightful German government from doing the will of the people”. Making this statement to a meeting of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the Moscow-funded West German Communist party; Reimann stressed the importance of being independent and having true self-determination for the new Federal Republic in all affairs, including making changes to the Basic Law and other forms of governmental rule. The Western powers, pressed for comment, all delivered similar condemnations of Reimann, with the US High Commissioner for Germany John McCloy responding that Reimann is “nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin, elected fraudulently and not by the will of the German people.” Reactions from the Eastern Bloc have been generally muted, but reports from the Kremlin indicate that the Soviet leadership seems generally pleased with the current situation in West Germany."
 Reimann.11.d:0 "It was mid-day as the Federal Republic’s ostensibly presidential plane, an old de Havilland Comet used by the British occupational forces, came in for a landing at Vnukovo International Airport outside Moscow, landing smoothly on the tarmac.\n\nStepping out of the plane to a military band and honor guard of Soviet soldiers, Reimann smiled as he walked down the stairway, nodding at the flagbearers, who played the German national anthem as well as the Soviet national anthem. Shaking hands with what he presumed as one of Stalin’s aides, he and his delegation got into a black sedan, speeding away towards Moscow city center and the Kremlin.\n\nAn hour or two later, after seeing more drab apartment buildings than he could count, they arrived at the Kremlin, being immediately rushed into the complex, exiting and walking through corridors to reach the Office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin.\n\nEntering the office and shaking hands with Stalin, Reimann immediately felt the presence of an almost godlike figure, who smiled and maintained his humility with such as man as Reimann. The men talked briefly, sharing pleasantries, with Stalin complimenting Reimann for having his communist movement elected to federal office. Before posing for pictures and shaking hands again, Reimann was ushered away, back out of the Kremlin complex, with a feeling of superiority within him."
 Reimann.12.d:0 "Finally, after months and months of deliberation and controversy, the Bundestag, composed of mainly KPD members and hardline SPD members with their CDU opposition, has agreed on a new Basic Law. Decrying the old document as “imperialist shackles,” the Federal Commission on Constitutional Affairs decided between amending the current document or making a new document, and after that time, the law and its contents have been finalized. Roundly condemned and fought to the death by the CDU opposition and the remaining Western occupational and military authorities, the new Basic Law is expected to completely restructure all aspects of West German governmental, civic and social life, particularly in favor of the Communist Party of Germany."
 Reimann.13.d:0 "TO: Office of the Chancellery\nFROM: Inspector-General of the Bundesgrenzschutz\nSUBJECT: State of the Armed Forces and Role of the Military\n\nChancellor,\n\nBased on a current review of the Bundesgrenzschutz (Federal Border Guard) conducted by my office, we have determined that the BGS is wholly unequipped and underfunded to provide any military assistance in the event of a governmental or geopolitical crisis involving Germany. In any event, the following recommendations are offered as a way of making the BGS a capable military force to support the nation’s needs.\n\n1. Formation of naval and air components of the military as a means of protecting the northern coast and inland waterways of Germany as well as providing aerial coverage of the nation, taking away such responsibilities from the BGS.\n\n2. Undergoing massive procurement of equipment from the Soviet Union, such as T-54 tanks, MiG-15 fighters and other aircraft, and some naval equipment.\n\n3. Reinforcing conscription policies, as well as introducing more ideologically based military instruction, including the importance of serving one’s country.\n\nIt is my hope that this will allow our military to regain a level of power unseen, for the protection of our country and of our interests."
 Reimann.14.d:0 "Bam bam bam.\n\nThe judge set his gavel on the dais, bringing the criminal trial against former SS-Standartenfuhrer Friedrich Stahl to order. With television cameras positioned throughout the room, Stahl stood, shackled, in a glass chamber, surrounded by two armed BGS guards with holstered pistols and MP bands on their arms.\n\nThe judge spoke, with a loud, booming voice. “Herr Stahl, you have been charged by the Federal Republic of Germany for actions against the German people, treason, and crimes against humanity. By the power vested in me by the will of the German people I find you guilty of all charges and sentence you to execution by firing squad, just as you did to those German Jews during the war. Case adjourned.”\n\nBam bam bam. The front of the glass case opened and shoved along, Stahl was dragged by the two BGS officers out of the courtroom to a holding area where he would shortly be taken to be executed. The back of the glass case opened, and another former SS officer, an SS-Standartenfuhrer Hans Ehrler, was pushed in.\n\n “Herr Ehrler, you have been charged by the Federal Republic of Germany for actions against the German people…”"
 Reimann.15.d:0 "“Germany today is a hotbed of decadence, just like the West!”\n\nInside the large Mathaser beer hall in Munich, Reimann’s booming voice echoed, this first statement eliciting not much applause. This point was moot, evidently, since Germany was still a somewhat smoking ruin, with little decadence outside of Western military bases. Perhaps something else, he thought.\n\n “The decadence and cultural abuse inflicted on us by the National Socialist government before us was disastrous. We must embark on a new culture struggle, a “kulturkampf” to return Germany to a new era of cultural revolution and understanding!” This elicited a little more applause, but Reimann knew the audience needed more, a hook.\n\n “The previous government’s relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, a bourgeois, anti-communist and anti-socialist dissident organization, revealed their true tendencies. Hundreds if not thousands of our brethren were arrested, tortured, or killed by the Nazi government and assisted by the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican! Even now, Nazi gold is sitting in the Pope’s coffers! Our government is going to tackle this issue, to take care of the church to prevent its interference in our internal affairs and those of our people!”\n\nAnd so it began, as Reimann walked away, some of the people cheering, some not, but regardless, the “Neue Kulturkampf” would begin."
 Reimann.16.d:0 "Walking into the Altes Stadthaus located in East Berlin, Reimann was nervous. He wasn’t sure why; after all, this conference was merely meant to be a formality. While the approval of the KPD in West Germany was moderate at best, he saw the more clear loyalty to the East German Socialist Unity Party; probably due to years of Soviet occupation. He had had many telephone calls and letters back and forth with the General Secretary of the SED Central Committee, Herr Walter Ulbricht, but his aides had more communication with the leaders he was due to meet today, in the so-called “Berlin Conference”.\n\nSitting down in a meeting room, Reimann finally got the opportunity to meet the other East German officials; mainly, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Otto Grotewohl; and the President of the Republic, Wilhelm Pieck; along with other lower ministers, SED officials, and a small coterie of Soviet representatives. Reimann’s delegation was rather small, as he was trying to keep a low profile in his trip to East Berlin as not to attract too much attention from the West.\n\n “Thank you all for allowing us to come here to East Berlin today. I must say that this is a beautiful city, and a perfect example of the socialist dream that we all must advance.”\n\n “Thank you, Chancellor Reimann. All of us, and the people of East Germany, share the profound hope that this conference can be beneficial and end with a peaceful reunification of the German nation under socialist ideals.”\n\n “Yes, my government and the people of West Germany agree. Now, shall we get down to business?”\n\nAnd with that, the days of negotiation would begin."
 Reimann.17.d:0 "After what was weeks and weeks of negotiation and grousing about details of the agreement, and careful avoidance of the Western occupation zones of Berlin, Reimann’s West German delegation and the East German governmental delegation were ready to sign the agreement. As much as Reimann hated to allow it, a group of international press correspondents were in the Schonhausen Palace, the residence of the East German President, to cover the unification treaty signing.\n\nAs flashbulbs went off, reporters from all nations, half from the West and half from the East, watched as Reimann, East German General Secretary Walter Ulbricht, and Soviet Marshal Andrei Grechko, as Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, sat down at a long table, with three copies of the 1953 Unification Treaty in front of them.\n\nAfter saying a few words, the three men put pen to paper and signed their copies, passing the copies around. The press continued to take pictures and ask questions, while Reimann, Ulbricht, and Grechko posed for pictures.\n\nA moment later, one of Reimann’s aides leaned over to whisper something in his ear.\n\nReimann’s face contorted, as his fountain pen dropped from his hand, landing on a copy of the treaty and beginning to blot, bleeding through the paper. Looking over at Ulbricht and Grechko, then the press, Reimann rose, grabbing his aide and rushing out of the room."

 Gehlen.0.d:0 "The officers had rarely met in person, and almost never together. In the era of Reimann, it was a good idea to stay to a normal routine, as to not attract too much attention to their cause.\n\nSitting in the recently vacated Federal Chancellery in Frankfurt were six officers, all of whom from the oldest and largest Bundeswehr ground forces; Reinhard Gehlen, Erich von Manstein, Hans Spiedel, Adolf Heusinger, Wolf Graf von Baudissin, and Hans Rottiger. Swarming with lower officer aides and guards, the six men were chatting among themselves, when Gehlen rapped on the conference table, quickly dispersing all noise\n\n “Welcome gentlemen, and thank you all for devoting yourself to this endeavor. The reports are still coming in but it appears we have freed the German people from the communist menace.”\n\nThe room briefly burst into applause before Gehlen rapped again, motioning for General Hans Speidel to speak.n\n “This body must assert itself as the legitimate government of the Federal Republic and one of the ways to do that is to elect a Chairman of this Officers’ Committee. This Chairman will act as the head of this body and the head of state, representing the interests of the Federal Republic with the Western Allies and otherwise abroad.”\n\n “There are two leading candidates; Generalleutnant Reinhard Gehlen, and former Generalfeldmarschall Herr Erich von Manstein. Gentlemen, please write your votes on the piece of paper in front of you and hand them to the adjutant.”"
 Gehlen.1.d:0 "It had been a few days since he was “elected” Chairman of the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee, in a landslide, and as Reinhard Gehlen stood, smoothing his uniform, adjusting the medals and insignia, watching the crews set microphones and cameras in front of the podium, adjusting the emblem behind it, he thought about what he’d say. This would be a breeze, but placating all parties was the difficult part.\n\nSeveral minutes later, Gehlen took his place at the podium, checking his speech one last time before an aide signaled that they were live\n\n “Citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany. Heavy is the shoulders that bears the responsibility of saying this, at this dramatic moment in German history. As a proud officer of the Bundeswehr, this is my duty to bear, and one that I do not take lightly, as the future of our Republic is at stake. I announce today that a formal provisional military government has been formed, composed of myself and other army personnel, in our duties as the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee. Some may decry this as being undemocratic and authoritarian, but this is a temporary change of government as a response to the threats and repression experienced under former Chancellor Max Reimann. We wish to return the Federal Republic of Germany and its citizens to an anti-communist bulwark against Soviet aggression and cooperation with the Western Allies. Our government will be announcing a number of policy changes in the coming days. We thank you for your cooperation, and Guten Nacht, Deutschland.”"
 Gehlen.2.d:0 "PROVISIONAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT ORDER NO. 3\n\nBONN, DEUTSCHLAND, [GetDateText]\n\nPOLICY RELATING TO THE BASIC LAW OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY\n\nNoting the importance of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany as a founding document that allows widespread political rights and provides for a democratic system as a whole,\n\nNoting with concern the changes made by the previous Communist government led by Max Reimann with the intent of dismantling said democratic institutions and undermining the will of the people,\n\nUnderstanding the immense duty that all Bundeswehr officers feel in their responsibility to govern and protect the citizenry from dangerous Communist subversion,\n\nThe Bundeswehr Officers Committee decides the following:\n\n1.

The Bundestag will remain as an advisory body, but will be non-political in nature and will represent the civilian sector of the population.\n\n3.

 Gehlen.3.d:0 "It was a quiet night in Bonn, as Gehlen walked into the conference room, where Spiedel, Manstein, and a few other lower-ranking officers hovered, passing papers. Sitting down, he noticed a new officer sitting at the end of the table, shuffling around notes and papers, closing his suitcase.\n\n “Hans, who’s this?”\n“Johannes Stumm, Berlin Police; and Captain Markus Herrlein, Military Police Command. Reinhard, there’s been a development in the Reimann affair.”\n“Welcome, gentlemen. What’s the situation?”\n\n “Former Chancellor Max Reimann fled to East Berlin upon signing the illegitimate unification agreement and our forces seized power in Bonn. Since then, we have been struggling to find and capture him. Our agents have located him in an apartment in East Berlin, but the East German and Soviet authorities have prevented our access to capture him, citing his “importance to the socialist cause” and their sovereignty being violated. We are seeking further solutions to get around this to arrest Reimann who we believe is coordinating communist subversion in the country.”\n\n “Very well. Ideas? Let’s go around.”\n\nSpeidel began. “It’s clear that this is an access issue - why not go through the Allied Control Council, or the Commandants of the Allied occupational sectors? This is an international issue that can be solved via negotiation.”\n\nManstein piped up. “With respect to General Spiedel, diplomacy will get us nowhere. Reinhard, you know as well as I do that utilizing our intelligence and military assets will result in getting Reimann more effectively than talking until we’re blue in the face, while he could be coordinating attacks against us. We should cooperate with the Allies for an extraction operation.”\n\nStumm and Herrlein nodded. “Both ideas are workable, although obviously the latter idea is riskier and would involve our capabilities more.”\n\n Gehlen nodded. “Thank you gentlemen. That being said, I think we should...”"
 Gehlen.4.d:0 "It was a rainy morning at the Kammergericht as two covered VW Kubelwagens, decorated with the Bundeswehr insignia, pulled up and parked, with the officers inside it rushing in, briefcases and overcoats rushing.\n\nMarching down the marble floors of the building, the officers made their way by American, British, and French officers, all who stood in bewilderment as they proceeded toward a conference room, where their bosses sat inside.\n\nAs Gehlen and his deputies entered, he shook hands with American Major General George B. Honnen, British Lieutenant General William Oliver, French General Pierre Manceaux-Demiau, and Soviet Major General Pyotr Dibrova. Sitting down, Gehlen began, as his aides handed out documents.\n\n “I know that bringing you all here must have been a surprise, and I certainly don’t intend to bring up any hurt feelings among the occupational authorities,” glaring at Dibrova as he spoke.\n\n “However, there is one issue that I’m sure all of you know must be addressed. The communist ex-Chancellor and agitator Max Reimann, who has committed treason against the Federal Republic of Germany, has seeked asylum in East Berlin. We intend to have him extradited and tried in front of a jury of his peers.”\n\nDibrova, who had restrained himself until then, burst out.\n\n “No! Herr Reimann is entitled to stay where he is for the security of socialism and as protection against fascist elements such as yourself! We will not stand for this; this conversation is over.”He stormed out, leaving papers flying and slamming the door behind him, boots loudly stomping away toward God knows where.\n\nGehlen looked at the other officers, who appeared as if they also wanted to leave. “Surely we can seek your help on this? My officers have assured me that negotiation is a much better solution than actually just arresting Reimann.”\n\nHonnen looked up. “General Gehlen, as much as we would love to have Reimann in our custody, he is in the Soviet occupation zone and we have no right to get him. The Soviets have to hand him over, and if they want to keep him, they’re entitled to. The best we can do is send a telex to our governments and hope that they issue a diplomatic protest to release Reimann, but unless God intervenes, it seems unlikely that they will release him. I’m sorry.” The British and French officers also nodded, dejectedly.\n\nGehlen frowned, thinking harder. Surely there had to be something to solve this."

Three teams of agents will be flown into West Berlin, and will enter into East Berlin via Checkpoint Charlie posing as a group of West German businessmen and military officers on a normal liaison mission. They will then change clothes to pose as East German emergency personnel and law enforcement. The three teams will consist of BND/MAD officers (Team Eins), CIA officers (Team Zwei), and Berlin Police/BKA officers (Team Drei).\n\n2. The teams will proceed to Hellersdorfer Strasse 179 in East Berlin, where the subject is located. Team Eins and Zwei will enter the building, extract Reimann, drug him, load him onto a stretcher, and take him past his bodyguards where he will be loaded into a vehicle. Because of the emergency, Team Drei will provide outside guard support from Soviet authorities and Volkspolizei, as well as cutting telephone cables and other communications equipment. Team Drei is ordered to defend themselves if fired upon and to target East German forces before targeting Soviet authorities to minimize the scale of an international incident.\n\n3. All Teams will, with all deliberate speed, proceed back to West Berlin on the justification that Reimann needs immediate hospitalization at a hospital in the western part of the city and that Soviet officials will be along shortly. Reimann will be taken to the US Military Liaison Mission Headquarters, where he will be held until a flight of all teams can be arranged back to Bonn.\n\nWe have moderate confidence that this plan will succeed and will provide adequate extradition of Reimann, with the subsequent outrage from the Soviet authorities and the Eastern Bloc.\n\nSIGNED\nGeneraloberst Erich von Manstein\nVice Chairman, Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee; Provisional Military Government, Office of Intelligence"

However, our office has prepared the following recommendations for economic policy in order to stabilize and grow the German economy.\n\n1. The immediate release of all consumer goods and automobile manufacturing facilities from government nationalization, an action originally ordered by the Communist regime.\n\n2. Reshuffling leadership of our coal and steel companies to include state-appointed directors loyal to the regime.\n\n3.

 Gehlen.8.d:0 "As little Hans came home from school, he threw his backpack against a chair and flopping down onto the floor, switching on his family’s new black-and-white television to see what was on.\n\n “How do you plead, Herr Schweppenstette?”\n\n “Not guilty, your Honor.”\n\nHans looked up to see an unkempt man, clad in a prison jumpsuit, handcuffed and standing in a glass case facing the court, flanked by two Bundeswehr officers in MP helmets.\n\n “You have been accused of the charge of treason against the people of Germany, and fermenting resistance against the Provisional Military Government of Germany. This court finds you guilty, and sentences you to prison and hard labor for twenty years.”\n\nBANG.\n\nJolting up, Hans, scared, turned the TV off, as his mother came into the room, having been in the bedroom.\n\n”Dear, what’s wrong?\n\n “Mutti, what’s happening on the TV?”"
 Gehlen.9.d:0 "“People of Germany!”\n\nGehlen, adorned in his formal dress uniform, stood in the Marienplatz in Munich, facing a crowd of hundreds and an assembled press and TV corps.\n\n “This is an extremely hard speech to make but one that needs to be done. Only a stone’s throw away, over thirty years ago, Hitler and the Nazis attempted a coup against the Bavarian state. While unsuccessful, it led the way for the Third Reich, which while I and other officers served under, was a grievous stain on Germany’s history that cannot be forgotten. In particular, the anti-Semitic rhetoric that was associated with the Hitler regime, that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of innocent Jews, is unconscionable. The Provisional Military Government of Germany, composed of Bundeswehr officers, unequivocally condemns all forms of anti-Semitism or discrimination against persons of Jewish descent. We have come to a period of reconciliation in this country and this government is committed to ensuring that German Jews can live peacefully in West Germany. Danke schon.”\n\nThe crowd was rather silent, for a while, beginning to clap as Gehlen walked off the stage. It was the first step, and as much as he felt uncomfortable doing it, it was a good move in the right direction."
 Gehlen.10.d:0 "As the judge put on his robes, he did not want to have to do this. Being a civilian judge, he felt uncomfortable ever since the junta, calling themselves the “Provisional Military Government of Germany” came to power; and now, he must oversee a trial of the previous Chancellor.\n\nEntering the courtroom, it was empty, but almost too empty. The judge saw the TV cameras at the end of the room, the empty glass chamber where previous communist sympathizers had stood in shackles, surrounded by scowling Bundeswehr MP officers. Those officers were here, but standing at the edges, smoking, with little else to do.\n\nAs the clock struck 10, the prosecutor and court reporter came in, and the three looked through their papers before beginning.\n\n “This begins the case Provisional Military Government of Germany vs. Max Reimann in absentia. Herr Prosecutor, what are the charges?”\n\n “Your Honor, the Provisional Military Government of Germany charges Herr Max Reimann with treason against the German people, subversion, working as a foreign agent, ordering surveillance and persecution of countless numbers of Germans during his time as Chancellor, and being a member of a banned political party, the KPD.”\n\n “Herr Reimann, how do you plead?”\n\n Silence, as it was designed.\n\n “Being in absentia, this court presumes his guilt and finds him guilty of all charges.”\n\nBANG.\n\n “Herr Reimann, you are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment.”\n\nBANG. BANG.\n\n “This court is adjourned.”\n\nAs the cameras flickered off and the guards returned to their normal composure, the judge sat in his chair for a moment thinking, for years he had been an accomplished jurist, but now, known by some as an anti-communist hero, and to others, a class traitor, an puppet of the fascist dogs above him."
 Gehlen.11.d:0 "“Esteemed delegations of the United Nations!”\n\nGehlen stood, standing tall over the stone podium, as usual in his dress uniform. This was a chance for the German people to redeem himself, and the general had to make sure that everything went right.\n\n “This is an important day for all free nations of the world. While Germany is only an observer state to this body, I am honored to speak here today.”\n\n“The past few years in the Federal Republic have been truly life-changing for all. From being occupation zones, to rule by a communist near-authoritarian Chancellor, to liberation by the Bundeswehr, the German people have been through much since the end of the Second World War.”\n\n“My officers and I want to be clear about our governing role in Germany. We are benevolent dictators, to preserve the stability of the Federal Republic from communist infiltration and to enshrine democratic and anti-communist ideology for all. For all that oppose us, be forewarned, we have more powerful friends, and a capable military force that will go to great lengths to defend our soil. Thank you all for your time.”\n\nShort and to the point. Stepping off the stage, he could only hear about half of the room clapping, and staring at the Soviet delegation, walked back to his seat. This was only the beginning."

 Gehlen.13.d:0 "BONN (AP) - Spanish ruler and Generalissimo Francisco Franco visited the capital of West Germany today, being warmly welcomed by the Chairman of the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee and military commander General Reinhard Gehlen, as well as Vice Chairman and Minister of Defense General Erich von Manstein and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Interior General Hans Speidel, all from the West German Bundeswehr. After attending a lavish diplomatic reception hosted by the military government’s rather small Foreign Affairs Office, Franco and his deputies entered into diplomatic discussions with Gehlen and his officers, signing a communique on the strengthening of bilateral ties between West Germany and Spain. Having a tenuous relationship since the Second World War, this development represents the West German junta’s new foreign policy of seeking closer ties with countries like Spain with similar anti-communist military governments."
 Gehlen.14.d:0 "“Communism is a stain on the world as an ideology, and one that merely re-appropriates fascism into a left-wing ideology ‘for the people’ that results in their being ruled by an authoritarian dictatorship.”\n\n “For those that argue that this government is no better, you are wrong. This government is military men, proud anti-communists, men devoted to maintaining the security of Germany against communist subversion and the spread of their cancerous ideology and economic system throughout Europe and the world. Yes, it was necessary to suspend some measures of government, but only for the express reason of preventing those institutions from being abused by communists and the left-wing, who prefer to exploit perfectly functional democratic institutions to serve their authoritarian desires.”\n\n “Karl Marx is not a true German. Many Germans are proud God-fearing Catholic conservatives, Germans that prefer capitalism and its innovation for economic growth to centralized economic systems where citizens are told where to work and how long to work, to produce defective products and be paid pennies on the dollar to Western countries.”"
 Gehlen.15.d:0 "As 5-year old Szabo trudged down the dirt path, he was tired, and hungry, he thought. Looking up at his mother Marton, who was carrying his brother Miksa, he hoped they were close. They had been moving through Czechoslovakia for days, fleeing the violence and death taking place in Budapest. There was no talking, only thinking.\n\nSmoking a cigarette, Helmut slung his Gewehr on his shoulder, taking puffs every now and then, staring out onto the Czech frontier. He had been deployed to the small town of Furth im Wald on exercises, but was assigned to pull border guard duty against communist forces in Czechoslovakia. Despite what his commander had told him, the border was quiet as usual around almost dusk. They had been warned about more refugees fleeing the East, due to some sort of uprising in Hungary. Helmut couldn’t even point to Budapest on a map, but he had seen pictures of the T-54s patrolling in the streets, Soviet soldiers in fierce firefights.\n\nAs he put down the remains of his cigarette into an ashtray and picked up a pair of binoculars, Helmut could see two figures in the distance - a mother and child perhaps?, he thought.\n\nMoving out of the guard shack to get a closer look, there was a mother and child, and a baby as well, and a carriage full of their things. Waking up the two other soldiers, Thomas and Artur, the three of them moved out, one getting on the radio to their barracks to ask for assistance.\n\nAs Szabo continued to walk alongside his mother, he began to see the border crossing, adorned with a large eagle in the West German emblem, and a large, fortified crossing gate. There were three soldiers, two of them with rifles, speaking in an unknown language to him. Marton began to speak up as they got closer to the gate, and while the soldiers looked scared, they were holding their guns carefully.\n\n “Refugee! Menekült!”\n\n "Hände hoch! Halt!” The two Hungarians instinctively raised their hands, as Helmut came towards them, shouldering his rifle for a moment.\n\nTurning back, the German soldier yelled something to the others, Marton could see. They were wearing old Stahlhelm helmets, almost no one in Europe could forget, she thought, as they raised the gate and led her and Szabo in with their things. They were finally free, she thought, as they struggled to communicate with the Germans, who were doing their best to hide their scared composure."
 Gehlen.16.d:0 "Average West German citizens woke up today to Bundeswehr troops actively deployed in their communities, as part of a massive deployment plan approved by the Provisional Military Government. Declared by a government spokesperson as “a deterrent and anti-subversion measure,” all major cities, including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, Cologne, Bonn, and Nuremberg are garrisoned by at least one division’s worth of soldiers, equivalent to about 8,000 men each. Mostly composed of infantry or mechanized infantry soldiers trained in urban combat and military policing, these forces have retained their normal duty of policing the streets and setting up roadblocks around major squares, government buildings, transportation facilities and other vital infrastructure, in the case of a Communist or other opposition terror attack. Described as only one part of the military government’s massive counter-insurgency program, this deployment is expected to continue indefinitely, until the government can ascertain that all cities and communities are secure."

 Gehlen.18.d:0 "While Hans hated history class ordinarily, he found it more entertaining today with the addition of a new student to his classroom: a Hungarian boy who fled. Hans had no idea why or how he had got here, but all he knew was that the boy, named Szabo, did not speak very good German and was learning, which earned the ire and teasing of his classmates.\n\nLooking at a new textbook on his desk, Hans sat down, putting his bag down, as the class began, with a stern-looking older man, the teacher, came in and closed the door.\n\n “Guten Morgen, Kinder!”\n\n “Guten Morgen, Herr Professor!” the class responded in unison.\n\n “Turn to page 30 of your books, children. Let’s start the lesson.”\n\nHans dutifully turned to the page, where it showed several color pictures of Wehrmacht generals and Nazi officials, including Hitler, Goering, and Rommel. This was the part of the class that Hans hated, where the children had to read, while the teacher waited.\n\n “The National Socialist regime, while responsible for authoritarianism and many deaths, was also important for the development of Germany on the world stage and the rebuilding of industry and society after the end of the First World War. While the NSDAP’s rampant anti-Semitism and racism, which culminated in their imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of minorities, they also were responsible for the creation of the Autobahn highway system, the Volkswagen car, Fanta soda, and the expansion of the glorious German military which protects our borders and internal security.”"
 Gehlen.19.d:0 "“People of Germany! My fellow citizens! It is time to discuss a subject that I have put off for a long time now, one that needs to be discussed. Our government has officially come to a consensus that the Holocaust must be addressed.”\n\nHe paused just then, for a long enough time that the TV camera operator shot him a look.\n\n “The atrocities committed by the National Socialist regime, some that many of us may bear complicity for, were immeasurable. It is still unknown how many innocents died, but it is estimated into the millions.”\n\n “We are accused of being fascists; of wanting to return National Socialism to Germany, to begin a Fourth Reich. This is not true. Yes, many officers in this government were former National Socialist and Wehrmacht officers that bore complicity for so-called “war crimes” during the Second World War. However, we are benevolent authoritarians. This regime will end, when the threat of communism in Germany is eradicated, when the virus of Soviet aggression stops infecting our populace.”\n\n “This government and the Bundeswehr at large formally and unequivocally condemns the Holocaust and all forms of genocide in all forms, particularly against minorities based on racial or religious character. This is not what we want; in fact, all Germans should come together against this evil ideal. Times have changed in this country, and we are at the precipice of a new moment for Germany. Thank you all.”\n\nWith the TV cameras cutting off again, Gehlen wiped the sweat from his brow and left the podium. This was almost as painful as the public speech against anti-Semitism, but it was necessary, even if it attracted the ire of those in the committee."

They destroyed our homes and businesses, raped and killed our loved ones, and took our livelihood. The strategic bombing by the British and Americans of Hamburg, Cologne, and Frankfurt resulted in thousands of civilian deaths, all with no accountability after the war. And now, they divide Germany, and demand we bend to their will! On both sides, but particularly ours! Why did the Allied Powers allow a Communist to be elected! If not for the might of the Bundeswehr and our great German patriots, this country would be unified under the Communist menace, controlled by the horde of imperialistic and bloodthirsty Russians.”\n\nClapping, the officers cheered, continuing to scribble notes and talk amongst themselves.\n\n “We cannot change the past, but we can control the perception of it. Providing more blame towards the Allies, instead of holding them in high regard all the time, will provide greater perspectives and to tell the stories of the civilians, the family members that died to their hand. While we remain nominal allies with the West, we cannot forget their atrocities committed against us.

Manstein, accompanied by his deputies Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger, as well as a plethora of staff officers, got out, their boots cracking against the pavement as they approached the entrance, shaking hands with an American staff officer who had come to greet them.\n\n “Welcome to the Headquarters Building, U.S. European Command, General von Manstein.” Smiling slightly, Manstein remarked, while looking back at his colleagues. “It used to have a different name the last time I was here, Lieutenant.” \n\nThe American laughed slightly. “Yes, sir. We’ve been told not to call it that anymore, instead, we call it the Pentagon of Europe.”\n\nThis elicited a little laugh from some, but Manstein and his officers were quiet, as they proceeded through the cavernous building to a conference room. Entering, Manstein proceeded to shake hands with each of the commanders seated there, including two Americans, one British, and one French officer.\n\nThe senior American officer, General Alfred Gruenther, opened. “Thank you for coming down here to meet with us, General Manstein. It’s a pleasure to finally be hearing from someone at the Officers’ Committee.”\n “Likewise, General. Now let’s get down to business.”\n\n “Yes, General Manstein. Our superiors are concerned about your foreign policy positions, now that you have assumed power from the former Communist regime. We want to ensure that your interests match ours, and that the Allies can help Germany in any way they can.” The British officer nodded, while the French officer stared at the floor.\n\nErich looked around, nodding to Speidel and Heusinger, before speaking. “Generals, there is nothing to worry about. I meant no harm in my rhetoric before about the Allies’ atrocities during the war. That was designed to bring the German people to support us, while also pinning blame on the Soviets. Although, you must admit, your countries were responsible for the deaths of many civilians.”\n\nThe junior officer, the commander of US Army Europe, spoke up. “General Manstein, while we appreciate your clarification now, it’s paramount that the West remain unified in the face of the Soviets. You cannot be condemning us for any actions we might have taken against the Nazis.”\n\n “I can, and I will. Let me be clear. The Officers’ Committee will promulgate what it wants, as the government of Germany.

 Manstein.7.d:0 "As the American military police officer turned the corner, rifle slung on his shoulder, he dropped his lit cigarette in surprise, as two black Mercedes shot past him at high speed, with German flags planted on their hoods. Three seconds later, a small, camouflaged truck sped by, with what appeared to be soldiers driving. Jumping into his patrol Jeep, he radioed headquarters, only to hear that “a scheduled diplomatic visit was occurring and that there is nothing to worry about”. Not satisfied, he proceeded to begin driving, following the motorcade from a distance.\n\nAs Manstein and Speidel emerged from their car at the Rathaus Schoneberg, the seat of the Mayor of West Berlin and the West Berlin Senate. As he passed, the truck behind deposited two squads of armed Bundeswehr soldiers, who quickly set out to form a perimeter and secure the area. Shaking hands with the Mayor, Manstein exchanged a few words before the motorcade started up again, moving closer and closer to the Soviet Zone.\n\nApproaching the Brandenburg Gate, the motorcade stopped near the Pariser Platz, repeating the procedure once again, to slightly more shock on the part of local pedestrians observing what was happening, as well as the American MP who had followed them.\n\n He watched as a soldier with a camera appeared, while Manstein and the West Berlin Mayor stood together, smiling.\n\n “We affirm West German control of Berlin, and urge all Allied parties to rescind their claims over Berlin immediately, as this is rightful German territory.

That is all.”\n\nAs the soldier with the camera switched it off and walked away, the group was approached by several East German policemen and a Soviet officer. The American GI picked up his radio again, letting them know of the situation, but not getting involved. Tensions in Berlin would only increase from here."
 Manstein.8.d:0 "To the government leaders of the so-called “German Democratic Republic,” now considered around the world to be an illegitimate puppet state of the Soviet Union,\n\nYou are no doubt aware of the feelings and intentions of the Federal Republic towards your country and claims to sovereignty. Our country and our people have been very clear on our position on communism, and it is clear that we will not let evil, communist, blood-sucking forces stand between a unified, capitalist, Germany, for all.\n\nLet this be a warning to the puppet government of the GDR: the Federal Republic, under my leadership of the Officers’ Committee and under the strength and capabilities of the Bundeswehr, will unify this great nation of Germany by force.\n\nThis is your final opportunity to seek a peaceful settlement. The Federal Republic will accept the annexation of the GDR provided that all traces of communism are gone. We are willing to come to the table, but our forces are ready to strike. We stand ready.\n\nSIGNED\nGeneraloberst Erich von Manstein\nChairman of the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee, Provisional Military Government of Germany"
 Manstein.9.d:0 "It was a rainy day, and Manstein sat in his office, telegrams strewn about the desk, still-burning cigarettes in the ashtray, and telephones ringing off the hook, both inside and outside the office. He knew precisely why; the statement to the East Germans had gone completely public, and despite his desires, both the Western Allies and the Soviets alike were losing their damn minds. He had not spoken to the other generals since before sending the statement, and was not expecting a positive response. Picking up a pen to dictate a new set of orders for the Bundeswehr, who stood on alert, Manstein was surprised to hear a commotion outside his office, then the door bursting open.\n\nGeneral Hans Spiedel, one of his deputies, stood, one hand on a holstered pistol, the other hand holding a set of typed papers. Behind him stood a lieutenant accompanied by a full squad of Bundeswehr soldiers, all armed.\n\n “By the authority vested in me by the Bundeswehr and the Provisional Military Government of Germany, I place you, Erich von Manstein, under arrest for willful endangerment, negligence, treason, and violating German military law. You are to be stripped of rank and detained until your criminal proceeding takes place.”\n\n “Hans. You can’t do this. That statement was simply a warning.”\n\n “You placed the Bundeswehr on alert status, for fuck’s sake, Erich! Do you know how many military liaisons from the Western Allies have been up my ass today? You threatened to provoke a war!”\n\n “I had my reasons. I thought you were with me all the way, but apparently not. You’re no better than those evil, godless, blood-sucking communists we have to rid this world of.”\n\nSpeidel, ignoring the comment, turned to the Bundeswehr lieutenant. “Search him, remove all weapons and cuff him. You know the drill, take him to the Kaserne, and for the love of God, do not leave the prisoner unattended.”\n\n “Jawohl, Herr General.” The officer saluted before waving his men forward, who quickly went about securing the room, confiscating Manstein’s pistol, and ushering him, in cuffs out of the room. Speidel, however, stayed. He knew that the country would be in turmoil, but some calls had to be made first."

 Speidel.0.d:0 "As the officers and aides piled into the conference room, there was an air of suspicion around. Most of the senior officers were smoking to relieve the stress, and as they waited for Speidel, most of them talked amongst themselves, swapping stories, opinions, and sharing notes.\n\nAs General Hans Speidel walked in, the room fell to a hush, with the officers staring rather incredulously at him.\n\n “Hello, gentlemen. Thank you for coming on such short notice. We have much to discuss.”\n\nSitting down at the head of the table, Speidel motioned for the door to close, with the MPs swiftly exiting the room.\n\n “As you all well know, Chairman von Manstein was arrested earlier today for treason, negligence, and willful endangerment. He is being held by the military police at an undisclosed location. Since this morning, I have been in discussions with Allied representatives. They supported Herr Manstein’s arrest and have formally encouraged me to take charge of the Committee indefinitely until the country can be stabilized. However, I told them that I would have to secure the Committee’s approval before anything can be legitimized.”\n\nThe room continued to be silent, before General Adolf Heusinger spoke up. “Herr General; your leadership as Vice Chairman of the Committee has been admirable. However, I think we as officers have mixed feelings on the fate of Herr Manstein. While it is true that his actions would have provoked conflict, I’m not sure that arresting and effectively ousting Herr Manstein would stabilize this Committee.” Some of the other officers nodded in agreement.\n\n “While I thank you, General Heusinger, I do think that my leadership as Acting Chairman will serve as an asset. The ultimate goal at this moment is to calm the populace, as well as to calm our benefactors that we have alienated in Washington and London. We must reassert our legitimacy.”\n\n“Very well, Herr Speidel. I think this Committee recognizes your work thus far and is willing to confirm you as Acting Chairman until the country can be stabilized. Thank you for your service.”\n\nSpeidel smiled. “Thank you, General.”"
 Speidel.1.d:0 "People of Germany,\n\nIt is with great importance and concern that I come to you tonight, as the new Chairman of the Officers’ Committee. As the press has reported, the former Chairman, General Erich von Manstein, was arrested by military police for treason and negligence against the Federal Republic, by abusing the power of the Bundeswehr to provoke a conflict with the Communist bloc. In this, General Manstein caused our western Allies to lose their confidence in us. The reputation of Germany abroad has been destroyed by Manstein’s reckless actions, which were designed to serve an ideological goal.\n\nThe Officers’ Committee is shocked and appalled by Manstein’s actions, and pledges to take all appropriate action against him to ensure justice. As the new Chairman, I pledge to keep the German people informed on the actions of the Committee and to ensure that the safety and security of the Federal Republic, from enemies, both foreign and domestic, are maintained.\n\nI urge you, people of Germany, to remain calm. General Manstein’s time is over, and a new era has come to the Federal Republic. The military will remain capable of defending the nation, but has been taken off combat alert. Germany will remain strong and stable as ever, despite this short crisis. I thank you all for your time. Good night."

However, considering the changes in the Committee in recent months, it has become clear that the Bundeswehr may be in need of changes, both in terms of mission as well as in organization and composition. The following two proposals reflect the Inspector-General’s Office recommendations for further reform to the Bundeswehr.\n\n1. Maintaining the Bundeswehr in its current form as a defense force. This would include defensive operations such as increasing security at the inner-German border, reforming to a voluntary enlistment policy, and receiving defensive assistance such as anti-tank weapons.\n\n2. Expanding the Bundeswehr to an offensive role, recognizing the need for German and Allied forces to counter the Soviet military capability in the East. This would include expanding conscription policies past their current levels, increasing domestic arms production capabilities, and the formation of more special forces and airborne response units.\n\nThese are all general proposals, but the time for reform in the Bundeswehr is now. It is my firm belief that either proposal will serve the people of the Federal Republic well and maintain operational readiness.\n\nSIGNED\nGeneral Friedrich Foertsch, Inspector-General, Bundeswehr Command"

The following actions will be taken with all deliberate speed:\n\n1. Immediately banning swastikas, SS lightning bolts, death’s heads, and all other associated National Socialist symbols and imagery, excluding the Iron Cross;\n\n2. Barring all former National Socialist officials, with the exception of sitting military officials, from holding public office, running for any election, or holding a position in the civil service;\n\n3. Prosecuting former General Manstein for his treason, negligence, and willful endangerment of the German people;\n\n4. Clarifying the truth of the Wehrmacht’s actions, with particular emphasis on its participation in atrocities, while also bearing in mind the historical development into the modern Bundeswehr;\n\n5. Placing limits on the political activities of communists and other left-wing political groups, including controlling publication and freedom to assembleIt is my profoundest hope that all of these directives will be followed to the letter and will not encounter any resistance, so that the Federal Republic can quickly be re-stabilized and our reputation can be saved from near ruin. \n\nSIGNED\nGeneral Hans Speidel, Chairman, Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee"
 Speidel.4.d:0 "As Speidel stood, waiting for the camera to flash red, he gathered his thoughts, imagining how other generals and leaders before him had performed in his very place. This was the first time Speidel had to give a speech of any kind, and on a serious, controversial subject, nonetheless. As the light blinked red, he took a breath and began.\n\n“Good evening, people of Germany. My name is General Hans Speidel, Chairman of the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee, and tonight, we are going to discuss a subject that lies deep in the hearts and minds of many Germans: the Wehrmacht. Thousands of our citizens served during the war, and fought honorably as they were ordered to by their superiors. However, the legacy of the Wehrmacht is a far more important one that should be addressed.”\n\n“My predecessor desired to erase the truth of the Wehrmacht’s actions and absolve it of any blame for crimes it committed during the War. He desired a return to the Wehrmacht, a return to the Reich, an idea that would simply not stand with the Committee nor the German people. The Wehrmacht is a different institution, in a different time. While some of its actions can be disputed, we cannot let the myth of the clean Wehrmacht stay. Even I, as a former member of that force, admit this. No military force is perfect, no matter how much we’d like it to be.”\n\n“People of Germany; I urge you to remember the Wehrmacht and its veterans well; but to not forget the tremendous damage it dealt in the history of Germany, and recognise the morality of war as it stands today. Thank you all and good night.”\n\n“You did very well, General.” The camera operator grinned, wheeling the camera back as Speidel left the podium, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. “Thank you.”"
 Speidel.5.d:0 "BANG BANG BANG.\n\nThe judge’s gavel echoed throughout the silent chamber as he began the proceedings. “Case No. 23413, Federal Republic of Germany vs. Erich von Manstein, on the charges of treason, negligence, and willful endangerment of the German people, is hereby called to order. Herr Manstein, how would you like to plead?”\n\nManstein, dressed in a prison jumpsuit and shackled, stood in a glass case, flanked by several, rifle-toting Bundeswehr military police guards. “Not guilty, Your Honor.”\n\n“Very well, Herr Manstein. Herr Prosecutor, please begin with your statement of charges.”\n\nThe prosecutor, another uniformed Bundeswehr officer, stood, holding a sheaf of papers. “Your Honor, the defendant is hereby charged with treason against the Federal Republic, as well as negligence and willful endangerment of the German people. The state considers in this instance that Herr Manstein, as former Chairman of the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee, used his position of authority to abuse the powers of the Bundeswehr, as well as mold the Federal Republic’s foreign relations to reflect antagonization of both our Allies and the Eastern Bloc. Herr Manstein also used his position of authority to reintroduce cultural policies commonly associated with the previous National Socialist regime, including allowing swastikas and banning Holocaust memorials. This fundamentally disrupted the German people and knowingly placed them in grave danger at the same time.”\n\nThe judge looked up. “Very well. This court, in accordance with the law of the Federal Republic, finds the defendant guilty. This court sentences you to life imprisonment in a military prison.”\n\nBANG BANG BANG. And just like that, the trial of Erich von Manstein had ended."
 Speidel.6.d:0 "As Speidel walked down the halls of the IG Farben Building once again, he remembered the last time he was here. An unfortunate time, in which he had to play an adjutant to a madman. As he walked into the conference room, nodding at the American MPs standing outside, he hoped this would go better than last time. There was a lot to smooth over.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen. How nice to see you all again.” Speidel smiled, removing his cap and shaking hands with General McAuliffe, the new Commander, US Army Europe.\n\n“Good to see you again, General Speidel. Glad to see we’re on better terms after last time.” They exchanged a small laugh, and as Speidel shook hands with the British and French representatives, the aides huddled together for a brief second. A minute later, the door was closed and all the officers were seated around the conference table.\n\n“First, gentlemen, I just want to be clear that as you can see, much has changed in Germany and the Committee since we removed Herr Manstein. Your governments understandably had concerns about what Manstein was doing, and particularly with his rhetoric against the Allies. Be assured that my leadership has changed the face of that rhetoric, and we are committed to a strong Western foreign policy.”\n\nThe three officers nodded. “That’s good to know, General Speidel, thank you. However, our concern lies in what your policies are and how you plan to approach the Soviets. As you well know, our concerns with Manstein were justified as he was threatening to provoke a war with East Germany, and by default, the Soviet Union. We want assurances that you will not do the same.”\n\nSpeidel smiled, adjusting his uniform slightly. “Gentlemen, I can assure you that this government will take no offensive action against the Soviets or the Bloc. We must remain strong and ready for any Soviet attack or incursion, and will operate our defense and foreign policy as such. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got another meeting I must get to. You know how to reach my office.”\n\nStanding up, the four men shook hands once more and exchanged pleasantries before Speidel and his staff left the room. Walking away, the Americans looked happy, he thought. Another crisis averted."
 Speidel.7.d:0 "New York (Reuters) - Today, the Federal Republic of Germany, provisionally headed by Bundeswehr General Hans Speidel, officially joined the United Nations as a full member. Previously being an observer, West Germany submitted an application to the Secretary-General upon Speidel’s ascension as Chairman of the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee.\n\nOfficially confirmed by the United Nations General Assembly, along ideological lines, the Federal Republic’s promotion in the international community represents the beginning of an effort by Speidel to recoup diplomatic losses following the previous leadership of General Erich von Manstein. However, this event also represents a flashpoint in the Cold War, particularly with harsh condemnations by East Germany and the Soviet Union, neither of whom recognize West Germany as a sovereign state.\n\nRepresentation in the UN is expected to be led by Felix von Eckhardt, a career foreign service officer and civilian who served as West Germany’s observer previously. In a statement, General Speidel said “Herr von Eckhardt is an experienced and qualified civilian with the skills necessary to represent the Federal Republic’s interests on the international stage.”"
 Speidel.8.d:0 "Zurich (AP) - West German leader General Hans Speidel landed at Zurich Airport today, being warmly welcomed by Swiss political and military officials in what would be the beginning of an official state visit to the neutral European country to the south of Bonn.\n\nWhile the schedule of Speidel and his entourage was not made to the press, it is expected that the German leader, accompanied by various political officials, will tour parts of Zurich, Geneva, and Bern, observe the Swiss Armed Forces during a parade, and have several meetings with the Swiss Federal Council, the Federal Parliament, and other Swiss federal ministries.\n\nThis continues a concerted push by the military-led West German government to concentrate on good relations with neutral countries, as opposed to strictly Western alignment. While this visit has attracted little attention from the superpowers, it remains significant in European affairs, particularly with the Swiss holding influence over international affairs and banking relations."
 Speidel.9.d:0 "Bonn (AP) - Around the globe today, embassies of the Federal Republic of Germany officially opened. As part of a new program by Germany’s provisional military government led by General Hans Speidel, the Federal Republic’s foreign affairs branch set about increasing diplomatic relations, in particular with the West.\n\nWith the opening of the German Embassies in Canada, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, and Portugal, the junta’s relations with the West continues to open. German embassies in Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines are also planned, as part of an Asian focus. Relations with the Communist bloc, however, continues unabated; with the only significant development being the opening of the new German embassy building in Moscow, thereby representing the entire Eastern Bloc. The American Secretary of State welcomed Germany’s new diplomatic opening, recognizing its’ achievements and hopeful for more in the future."
 Speidel.10.d:0 "Jeeps and sedans, adorned with American, British, and French flags whined to a stop as they pulled in front of the Federal Chancellery in Bonn, with their passengers quickly disembarking, moving to the back to begin unloading furniture and office equipment. The Bundeswehr military guards standing outside looked on with awe and wonder as dolleys containing filing cabinets, desks, and chairs began to enter the cavernous government building.\n\nAs the men proceeded upstairs, they ran into yet more bewildered Germans, both military and civilian, at a normal day’s work in the Chancellery. A memo had been sent out by Speidel’s office that morning, but clearly almost no one had read it, as they were busy with other tasks, such as running the country.\n\nThe lead American official, carrying a clipboard, emerged from the elevator, two soldiers behind him burdened with their dolleys of furniture. Proceeding down a hallway, past administrative desks, they stopped in front of a large office doorway. Checking his clipboard, the American official clicked his pen, before motioning for the soldiers to begin moving their cargo in. Hanging a sign on the door as they passed by, the passersby and military aides were surprised to see “American Supervisory and Regulatory Mission to the Federal Republic of Germany” appear. Several doors down, British and French officials were doing similar things, with the British Advisory and Assistance Mission to the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Mission Francaise a Bonn.\n\nSpeidel and his staff, clearly the only ones that knew, observed and smiled. Clearly this cooperation had moved to new levels, and hopefully this rather watchful eye from the Allies would prevent any mistakes from happening again."

The following are some empirical recommendations for the future economic policy.\n\n1. The Federal Republic is strongly encouraged to join the International Monetary Fund as soon as possible. This will help increase our international finance and balance of payments and may help receiving loans in the future.\n\n2. The expansion of coal industries in the Ruhr region. Previous regimes have attempted to do this but have not yielded appropriate results, and this in particular should be focused on.\n\n3. Following on to the previous recommendation, providing subsidies and/or assistance to major German companies, such as BMW, Volkswagen, and BASF to increase their efficiency and export values.\n\n4. Lastly, re-introducing state-approved workers’ organizations, in order to maintain some form of labor-management relations that will increase productivity and efficiency.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that this can only be the beginning of the return of German economic might to not only Europe, but the Western world at large.\n\nSIGNED\nChief Officer, Office of Economic Planning, Ministry of Finance"
 Speidel.12.d:0 "“Bonn (Der Spiegel) - To the surprise of most observers, including the Western Allies, West Germany announced the beginning of its nuclear program today, in a public address and press statement. Currently led by General Hans Speidel under a military committee, the Federal Republic becomes one of the few countries on Earth to possess nuclear capabilities, in one form or another.”\n\n“While it is not currently known whether the Germans will take a peaceful path or move towards acquiring nuclear weaponry, the reactions have been varied; with most of the Western Allies indicating tangible support, and as usual, the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc denounced this action as further escalation in the Cold War.”\n\nSpeidel smiled as he set the paper down, the large type splashed across the front page. “They’re right, after all. We haven’t yet determined the path of our program.” He nodded to the two aides, a colonel and a major, as well as a civilian official standing in the room.\n\n“A peaceful use would gain more acceptance within the international community and would have more support domestically, however, it has limited uses in the fact we would only be able to use it for research and as a power source.”\n\n“The proposal of a weapons program is also promising, but one that would culminate in a lot more dissatisfaction among our people and the Allies. I’m sure the Soviets would also feel very threatened by a nuclear power so close to their border. But as you know, General Speidel, the benefits to our military and tactical capability would be immense. A NATO nuclear deterrent here would preclude the Americans from stationing weapons on our territory.”\n\n“Very well, gentlemen. Thank you. If you could get me reports on each side we’ll make a decision on this very soon.” Speidel replied."
 Speidel.13.d:0 "Camera bulbs flashed in rapid succession as Speidel got out of his black Mercedes, being escorted by two Bundeswehr lieutenants as he proceeded towards the cleared area of the proposed new Federal Reactor Plant, where a patch of dirt had been cleared for the groundbreaking.\n\nStanding nearby, holding a pair of golden shovels, was the plant manager and the chief architect, behind which was standing the soon-to-be chief engineer of the plant. Speidel, walking over, smiled and chatted with the men for a few minutes before he was directed, with the other men, to take their shovels and pose for the press doing the groundbreaking. The men smiled as newsreel reporters took clips, of the officers and men shoveling the ground, symbolically marking the beginning of construction.\n\nSpeidel then made a short speech, remarking on the “might of nuclear power” and urging “the safe and careful use of atomic power in order to achieve energy independence and safe atomic research capabilities.” No mention was made of the junta’s apparent push towards peaceful nuclear power as opposed to nuclear weapons, as many political pundits had assumed would happen.\n\nAll in all, the success was apparent, and the public loved it, Speidel thought as he sped away after.

Overall, it was a success. These are the following results and recommendations:\n\n1. The drill operated on the premise that Soviet nuclear weapons had struck all major German cities, including Bonn, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne, Munich, and Nuremberg. However, we initially did not count strikes made against Allied targets in Germany such as military bases and other formations. This would likely increase the scope of any damage inflicted on the country in a Soviet strike, and will be useful for further planning.\n\n2. The public relations campaign was effective but could be expanded upon more. Initial interest was low, and the use of radio and television, rather than simply paper-based strategies, might attract the population more to a voluntary effort of civil defense.\n\n3. Alert efforts were effective, but must be improved. Several alerts were issued, but air raid and local civil defense officials were unwilling or unable to determine the scope of “damage.” Medical teams and personnel should also be brought into the fold.\n\n4. Military forces handled their role well, assisting in intercepting and repelling some attempts at nuclear strikes. However, their role should be increased to include both this role at nuclear airborne defense as well as tactical strike defense, as well as conventional defense from Soviet land forces.\n\nThis agency plans to continue these drills on a yearly basis and appreciates the cooperation of the Bundeswehr and Officers’ Committee in facilitating this drill for the national defense of the country.\n\nSIGNED\nPresident, Federal Agency for Technical Relief, Ministry of Interior, Federal Republic of Germany"

The legacy of my predecessors has been washed away, for good, and Germany has been transformed into a vibrant player on the international stage once again. Our economy is strong, and our people are happy.\n\nMy predecessor before me was determined to resurrect this Federal Republic as the Fourth Reich. I stopped him. The people of Germany stopped him. We have suffered through enough of the horrors of National Socialism and its flawed ideology. Under my administration, this government banned Nazi symbolism and took proactive steps to restrict former Nazi officials from holding high and important public office. Herr Manstein has been convicted and jailed for his crimes. The rule of law continues to survive in Germany.\n\nThe Bundeswehr under my leadership has been changed for the better. No more are the armed forces simply the tool of the leader, to do their bidding, but a force composed of individuals willing and ready to defend their country against threats, foreign and domestic. The Bundeswehr is equipped, supported, and ready for any challenge, be it from within our borders or from the East.\n\nOur economy has been rebuilt, as well as our foreign affairs. Our reputation on the world stage and in the international community has been strengthened. We have regained our economic power once again, and remain a powerhouse in manufacturing exports and finance.\n\nPeople of Germany, you should be proud. Much has been done, and thanks to you. There is much more to say, but I believe that the time of the military government has ended.

 Junta_Dem.1.d:0 "As the Gehlen-led Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee runs its course, several realizations have become apparent. For one, it was widely assumed by the limited press within West Germany, as well as from outside observers, that the Officers Committee would not last forever. Truly, the core goals of the officers have been accomplished, and the future seems uncertain.\n\nPressure from the Allies has been mounting, particularly on General Gehlen, to cede power in favor of democratic elections. Convinced that the Federal Republic has been appropriately rid of all Communist opposition, representatives from the US and Britain have “encouraged” Gehlen to begin the process for elections.\n\nGehlen and his adjutants, although fairly angry at the prospect, have agreed, reluctantly, as they consider Western support and military aid to be crucial to the continued maintenance and capability of the Bundeswehr. It is expected that Gehlen will use his already-accumulated political power and influence to openly endorse conservative and nationalist political parties, in an attempt to legitimately tip the scales of an upcoming free and fair election.\n\nThe future of West Germany seems uncertain, as the public looks cautiously to General Gehlen and the Officers’ Committee to provide guidance and the rule of law sufficient to return the country back to democracy."
 Junta_Dem.2.d:0 "As the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee, led by General Hans Speidel, continues its rule of stability in West Germany, concerns have mounted from the Western Allies about the continuance of the regime. While General Speidel is considerably more liberal than some of his fellow Bundeswehr officers, he is still a military officer, with previous experience in the Wehrmacht forces.\n\nPressure from the Western Allies, who have been nominally supervising and advising the junta, has culminated in their request for the Committee and Speidel to cede power, in return for free and fair elections. Speidel’s staff has reportedly been rather annoyed by this prospect, but have relented based on their previous alignment and cooperation with Western powers.\n\nIt’s widely expected by most political pundits and outside observers that Speidel will back or otherwise endorse the conservative parties expected to run in the forthcoming elections, in particular the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\n\nIt is not otherwise known of the future of West Germany, as democratic rule hangs in the balance. The world, on both sides of the Curtain, is eager to see what comes out of this, and what the people of the Federal Republic decide to do."

This was seen as fairly unsurprising, as those parties would continue to employ the aforementioned officers, as well as court support from the Western Allies for geopolitical purposes.”\n\nThe CDU functionary, setting down the paper. Very good. Yes, they were bringing back democracy, but since the left wing had been obliterated, there was nothing left but the conservatives and the right-wingers. A guaranteed victory for the CDU, he thought."

The Federal Republic has been rid of all Communist infiltration, and in our benevolence, we have accomplished much under military rule and supervision.\n\nThe Committee will, after all the appropriate preparations have completed, initiate provisional elections for the Federal Republic. These elections will return this country back to a democratic system, ensuring that the voices of the people are better heard, and that our international reputation continues to improve.\n\nWe are receiving significant support from our allies in the United States, Britain, and France in this matter.

We do this with all seriousness and formality as required.\n\nThis country has been through much since the beginning of this decade, not to mention the last fifteen years. The rule by this Committee was benevolent, and necessary for the security of the Federal Republic. My predecessor was removed and tried for the same reason. It is clear that the rule of law still exists in this country, whether it is ruled by a democratically elected Chancellor or an appointed military officer.\n\nUnder this Committee’s leadership, much has been done. The Communist menace has been removed, once and for all, as a leading force within the German political apparatus. Our economy has been reborn, we have confronted our tumultuous past, and our military has been reformed and enlarged. Our international reputation continues to improve, as we assert the rightful claim over all of Germany.\n\nHowever, as I have stated, it is time for this Committee to step down. The German people have tolerated our rule for enough, and it is time that we return to just military service, serving the country in this way. Further details on the election will be promulgated in the media and over official mediums. Thank you all and good night.”\n\nSpeidel sighed, wiping the sweat from his brow as the camera light blinked off. That was that, and that’s all there was to it."
 Junta_Dem.6.d:0 "“Munich (AP) - Across Germany, planes bearing the UN logo landed at airfields today, depositing their passengers, carrying their baggage and being greeted by local government personnel and military officials. At the request of the still-military-led West German Government, the United Nations Election Monitoring Mission for the Federal Republic of Germany was to begin, with an international contingent of UN election observers deployed to nearly every polling place in the country, with a focus on the major cities of Bonn, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, and Cologne.\n\nComing mere weeks after the Bundeswehr Officers’ Committee, the de facto ruling body of West Germany, announced provisional elections, the UN mission aims to make sure that the elections are freely and fairly done, ensuring there is no fraud or rigging, and acting as a non-partisan observing force between the military government and the population at large.\n\nAlthough concerns that the junta has already endorsed conservative candidates have been raised, the UN mission comments that “the Committee had full rights to endorse the CDU and DP, on the grounds that they are legitimate political parties.” It is expected that one of the two parties will win, and there will be little left-wing opposition to the new provisional government in the future.”\n\nGeneral [WGR.GetLeader] smiled, setting the paper down. “Excellent. They are here to do their job, and we’re here to do ours.” He looked up at an aide, sitting across the desk. “Allowing the UN to come in gives us more legitimacy, and ensures that a right-wing party will surely win. This is a win-win for us.” He smiled, picking the paper back up again."

 Adenauer58.1.d:0 "“Good evening ladies and gentlemen of the Bundestag!”\n\nAdenauer’s voice boomed at the podium as he faced his fellow lawmakers, at the Parliament Building in Bonn.\n\n“We are assembled here at a critical juncture in the history of the Federal Republic. Democracy has returned to Germany once more as the officers of the Bundeswehr and the people have granted the CDU the mantle of leadership.”\n\n“This new, democratic government, chosen by the people, has the important job of restoring democratic principles and institutions in this country. No doubt exists that the Bundeswehr exercised judgment and restraint in their rule of this country, but that time has passed, for good.”\n\n“This government will be committed to restoring the ill-fated 1949 Basic Law, enshrining our constitution, and outlining the duties of the Chancellor. All of this with your help.”\n\n“I am proud to lead this government. Under my government’s leadership, I am confident that Germany will continue its march into the light of success!”\n\n“Thank you all and good night. It’s time to get to work.”"
 Adenauer58.2.d:0 "“Bonn (Reuters) - Signing a bill in the Federal Chancellery today, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer restored the 1949 Basic Law, also known as the Grundgesetz, which functioned as the Federal Republic’s constitution and governing document until it was abrogated by communist KPD Chancellor Max Reimann during his regime.\n\nMarking the second official movement towards democratic institutions in West Germany, after the calling of elections, the Basic Law guarantees constitutional protections for the populace as well as redetermines the structure of the government, including executive, legislative, and judicial branches.”\n\nAs Adenauer read the paper, setting it down, his aide spoke up. “We’ve gotten it done, but there were a few changes that were made. However, the majority still remains, and that’s all that matters.”"
 Adenauer58.3.d:0 "ARTICLE 147 OF THE BASIC LAW OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY\n\n(1) If the Federal Republic of Germany is threatened with any constitutionally defined emergency, this Basic Law shall authorize the formation of an Emergency Government that will administer the Federal Republic’s functions until such time as the emergency declaration has been lifted.\n\n(a) “Constitutionally defined emergency” is defined as “any emergency, occurring within the borders of the Federal Republic of Germany, that threatens its sovereignty, defense capability, or otherwise harms or endangers citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany”\n\n(b) “Emergency Government” is defined as “a provisional ruling government with the express goal of maintaining the basic vital functions of the Federal Republic of Germany, including maintaining defense readiness, fiscal and economic policy, foreign policy, and other necessary government programs”\n\n(2) Until such time as the emergency declaration has been lifted, elections will not be held in the Federal Republic."
 Adenauer58.4.d:0 "As Max walked out of his apartment, heading to work, he saw a faded, worn, torn SPD poster on the wall. Stopping for a second, he snapped back to reality as he ran towards the tram, dashing on to grab a seat.\n\nThinking for a moment, he recalled the SPD of long ago, not the battered shell of a party it was now. The SPD of postwar Germany, the one sadly co-opted by communists and other KPD agitators, before being destroyed by the Bundeswehr junta which took over the country. He had always been a left-winger, a social democrat, but now he had no party to go to.\n\nGetting off the bus, Max walked into his white-collar job, one at an accounting and bookkeeping firm here in Frankfurt. Turning on the radio as he sat down at his desk, all he heard was “CDU, CDU”. Grimacing, he got to work, the hours speeding by, only stopping for lunch and a coffee break.\n\nMax stepped out of his office at 5, thoroughly exhausted from yet another day of mindless actuarial tables. As he walked out of the building, someone handed him a pamphlet, one brilliantly printed with “CHRISTLICHE DEMOKRATISCHE UNION DEUTSCHLANDS” on it, detailing the policies of the CDU (which he frowned at) as well as local chapters and meeting times. Max raised an eyebrow, about to throw it out, but had a thought. There was a meeting tonight at the local community center; how hard could it be? The CDU was a “Union” after all, surely they’d be willing to have some former Social Democrats."
 Adenauer58.5.d:0 "It was a warm day as Adenauer’s staff lined up outside the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, podiums and flags flying as the press arrived, setting up their cameras and taking preliminary notes.\n\nAdenauer stepped up promptly at 8:45, as the cameras began to flash. “I’ve been told I need to make this quick, as the market is eager to open this Monday morning.” This elicited a few laughs from the gathered crowd.\n\n“Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are here today to bring back, to reopen a vital part of not only the German economic system, but the new European economic community. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange has played a vital role since the 11th century when trade fairs began. It is considered the father of stock exchanges, and weathered through two world wars and military occupations without fail. It is my pleasure this morning to officially reopen the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as the leading exchange for the Federal Republic, and in so doing hope to show to the world that Germany is back, for good.”\n\nApplause rang as Adenauer smiled for a moment, before stepping over to a ribbon placed in front of the Exchange’s entrance and being handed a comically large pair of scissors. Pausing for cameras, he then cut the ribbon to more applause. A bell was rung, and the market began.\n\n Adenauer and his staff watched as brokers began to run around, ticker-tape starting to move around the building in large amounts. Today truly was a success."

 Hellwege58.1.d:0 "“Ladies and gentlemen of the Bundestag, it’s my pleasure to address you all tonight.” Chancellor Heinrich Hellwege intoned from the podium, at the first meeting of the Bundestag since provisional elections had been called by the Bundeswehr.\n\n“Much has gone on since this Federal Republic was founded, pulled from the clutches of the National Socialists and Communists who wished to mold the German people to their whim. Both tried to use historical nationalism to convince the people of their radical ideologies, while ignoring the true nationalism of the German people.”\n\n“My government, elected by the people, seeks to change that. German nationalism is built on conservative values, not Atlanticist and Western-backed values! We will be no pawn of a superpower as we have been for years!”\n\n“The role of religion and monarchy in this country is one that has been tarnished by atheist and democratic values that have eroded our historical value. The DP seeks to change this, by re-litigating the role of the House of Hohenzollern in the Federal Republic and restoring vital religious policies back to the law. Our conservative values will extend on the world stage, in working closer with fellow leaders in Europe and the West on vital matters such as security. Germany is back, for the better, returning to tradition.”\n\nMeeting with vigorous applause, Hellwege smiled as he finished his address. This was only the first step in his new tenure as Chancellor."
 Hellwege58.2.d:0 "The Bundestag chamber buzzed as the legislature prepared to take up one of its first, most contentious debates yet. The DP, maintaining its nationalist ideals, proposed several ways to reincorporate the House of Hohenzollern into the federal government, from eliminating their tax status and providing security details, to radical proposals such as providing Prince Louis Ferdinand, the heir to the throne, a position within the Government, possibly as Federal President.\n\nCDU members and the small faction of Social Democrats associated with it remain strongly opposed, with those opposition members exclaiming that “this country is a republic, not the Empire any longer!” DP and FDP members have pushed back, attempting to convince the opposition that “the House of Hohenzollern is historically and culturally significant and that they should not be relegated to the dustbin of history.” However, they are not convinced, protesting that the failures of the old German Empire, and World War I, stemmed from the monarchy, who was continually in control of the government and state, despite the trappings of democracy.\n\nHowever, the proposal about providing the House of Hohenzollern with tax benefits and minimal security has gained some ground, even with opposition figures, who recognize that the royals are not going anywhere any time soon, and that enshrining them as a cultural part of Germany, much like the British have, would be helpful, without sacrificing too much. The one limiting factor is allowing Louis Ferdinand to possibly run as Federal President, although he may not be interested in that opportunity despite his relative public popularity. What will the Bundestag do?"
 Hellwege58.3.d:0 "“Good evening. Thank you for allowing me to speak here at this meeting of the local German Party chapter. Tonight, I want to address you all on a serious threat to not only our party, but democracy at large. The influence and pervasiveness of the Socialist Reich Party, a close collaborator of what used to be the German Right Party, the DRP, has become dangerous, a threat to our people and a threat to the European continent. The Socialist Reich Party has no doubts about its goals; clear and present Nazist ideals, a restoration of a Fourth Reich, and a return to the ghastly policies of the previous era.”\n\n“While I do not deny that some members of the SRP fought valiantly during the First and Second World Wars, they are not fit to hold office, particularly with their radical and dangerous beliefs, which go against the entire moral code of not only our party, but against the beliefs and will of the people and the Federal Republic.”\n\n“We must do all that we can to prevent these monsters from usurping our legitimate national movement, like they did in the 1930s, and continue to keep this Federal Republic democratic, conservative and secure as it was then. This requires your help. Cooperation from all is required from this endeavor.”\n\nHellwege kept going on, as this speech to the local party chapter inevitably had to continue; but the message was clear to all, not just those sitting in the room: the DP is no friend to neo-Nazis."
 Hellwege58.4.d:0 "As Ludwig Erhard entered the conference room at the Federal Chancellery, he looked a mix between solemn and irritated, having been called to come the day prior. Sitting down, he noticed Hellwege sitting at the other end of the table, accompanied by Franz Blucher.\n\n“Well, now that I’m here, what can I do for you?” Erhard intoned, staring down the table, still continuing to wonder what Blucher was doing here.\n\n“Well, Ludwig, we’ve heard a lot about your economic ideas. I know you’re in the opposition party but our ideals are similar to yours and we’d like to work with you and make you Minister of Economics.” Hellwege opened. Blucher stood there, nodding.\n\n“What’s in it for me, other then being made Minister of Economics. Seemingly this is your way to “cooperate with the opposition.” Do you really want to give me autonomy on economic policy, or are you going to hamstring me into doing whatever your monarchist urges tell you, Heinrich?” Erhard blistered a bit, driving the point of his disaffection home.\n\nBlucher cut in. “Herr Erhard. We’ve known each other a long time, and when Chancellor Hellwege was searching for an economic minister, I recommended you, knowing full well that this would be your response, as well how it would look to the CDU and DP. But this is a raw deal. We are allowing the CDU to make economic policy, as their conservative and ordoliberal economic ideals are the same as ours. The only difference is that you are far more capable than any of our DP officials, and you can execute policy far more effectively. Plus, you have international connections that are valuable.”\n\nErhard seemed to soften, before starting up again. “I see. Well, I am interested, but as you probably know, I need to deliberate with members of my party before I fully accept. Consider this an informal yes, and I trust this is all off the record.”\n\n“Yes, Herr Erhard, it is. We thank you in advance for your willingness to serve the government, and please contact us when you’ve made your formal decision.” The three men exchanged handshakes, before Erhard left the room, presumably back to CDU headquarters."
 Hellwege58.5.d:0 "Madrid (AP) - West German Chancellor Heinrich Hellwege landed at Madrid-Barajas Airport today, marking the beginning of a four-day visit to Franco’s Spain. Viewed as unsurprising for the conservative and nationalist West German government, Hellwege plans to sign an agreement for further bilateral relations, as well as tour the Royal Palace of Madrid and other significant buildings in the city. Hellwege is also expected to meet with the Spanish leader, Generalissimo Francisco Franco, and other prominent Spanish and Francoist officials.\n\nHeavily sharing conservative and anti-communist attitudes, Hellwege’s visit is viewed by nearly all parties with little surprise. Most DP and CDU officials continue to agree with the visit, as building bilateral relations with another European anti-communist ally, while the small Social Democratic faction continues to decry it as bowing to dictatorships. The German public is unfazed though, and continues on with their lives, uncaring about pithy diplomatic visits."

They stated that he murdered 2 East German soldiers and then also defected to the West. They wish to put him in an a court and trial him. Werner Weinhold, while he did kill 2 East German soldiers, could prove an asset on the inner workings of the East German border guard and the positions of soldiers. However, if we keep him here, the East German government will be not happy. We need to make a decision on the extradition."

 wgr.202.d:0 "The Election of 1961 has arrived. For the first time, the SPD has a chancellor-candidate, who is not chairman of the party: Willy Brandt, the Governing Mayor of West Berlin. After the building of the Berlin Wall, he gained more and more sympathy, while chancellor Konrad Adenauer was criticized for not showing enough support for the people of West Berlin. Adenauer had to save the absolute majority of CDU and CSU, but, considering his age and his long term as chancellor, there were big doubts if he should lead the country in a fourth term."

According to his daughter, his last words were \"Da jitt et nix zo kriesche!\" (Kölsch slang for \"There's nothin' to weep about!\"). His state funeral in Cologne Cathedral was attended by a large number of international guests. One hundred and eighty countries were represented, included fifteen world leaders.\nAfter the Requiem Mass and service, his remains were taken upstream to Rhöndorf on the Rhine aboard Kondor, with two more Seeadler-class fast attack craft of the German Navy, Seeadler and Sperber as escorts, \"past the thousands who stood in silence on both banks of the river\". He is interred at the Waldfriedhof at Rhöndorf.\nWhen Germans were asked what they admired most about Adenauer, the majority responded that he had brought home the last German prisoners of war from the USSR, which had become known as the \"Return of the 10,000\"."

 Ostpolitik.2.t:0 "Der Warschauer Vertrag"
 Ostpolitik.2.d:0 "Today sees another victory for Ostpolitik. In Warsaw, West German Chancellor [WGR.GetLeader] and Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz have signed the treaty of Warsaw. The treaty commits both sides to nonviolence along with accepting the existing border-the Oder-Neisse line, imposed on Germany by the Allied powers at the 1945 Potsdam Conference following the end of World War II.\nWhile Poland is happy about the agreement, the same can't be said for West Germany. There, the opposition, has marked this policy as a betrayal of national interests. At the time the treaty was signed, West German commentators sought to maintain that this could not be a final settlement of the Polish border issue, because Article IV of this treaty stated that previous treaties like the Potsdam Agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement; so it might be argued that the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II-as provided for in the Potsdam Agreement."
 SDP_60s.1.t:0 "SDP Calls For Nuclear Free Europe"
 SDP_60s.1.d:0 "The ruling Social Democrat Party (SDP) of West Germany announced that it was calling for a nuclear free Europe. The government stated the people of Europe have long been held hostage by the nuclear arms race and the superpowers deploying such devastating weapons across Europe. The announcement has garnered support among not just Germans but Europeans across the continent who have felt powerless in the face of the nuclear threat. Across NATO there has been a growing sense of unease at the announcement. Some governments are privately sympathetic while others, especially the United States, view the announcement as potential sabotage that undermines the defense of Europe. There are even groups in the United States who are suggesting the announcement proves the SDP is a Soviet agent designed to sabotage NATO from the inside."
 Stammheim.1.t:0 "Opening of Stammheim Supermax"
 Stammheim.1.d:0 "West Germany opened a new supermax prison in Stuttgart. Called Stammheim Supermax Prison, the government believes the facility will be the most secure facility in the country. Indeed, the prison will not only house prisoners but have its own courthouse in which suspects maybe tried. This will prove especially useful in cases involving dangerous organizations as they will be unable to interfere with the legal process. The new warden noted the prison may end up being the not just the most secure prison in the country but perhaps even in the world. The prison took four years to be constructed and is expected to immediately house some of the most dangerous criminals and suspects."
 WGRPolitical.1.t:0 "The Grand Coalition"
 WGRPolitical.1.d:0 "With the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) coalition unraveled, it has announced the formation of a Grand Coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SDP). This will save the government as it lost its coalition allies but also ensure the coalition controls nearly ninety percent of the Bundestag. Considering the ideological differences between both parties, it is expected the government will have a difficult time maintaining control. For the CDU, this will mean a more tenuous ability to pass legislation and more compromises. For the SDP, the announcement has angered those aligned more to the left who see the Grand Coalition as a betrayal to party values. Student supporters of the SDP have expressed their outrage to the decision. Students are already preparing protests and to lead opposition to the coalition, but the new government believes it will be able to handle such dissent."
 WGRPolitical.2.t:0 "The Succession of Adenauer"
 WGRPolitical.2.d:0 "Konrad Adenauer quickly became the leading politician of post-war West Germany. He benefitted after the war from being dismissed by the British for advocating his position as equal to the Allied authorities, gaining him national legitimacy. He then tirelessly worked to make the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the leading national political party. As chancellor he advocated democratic norms and freedoms. However, he had promised the country he would resign before the end of his final term and following some recent scandals he cannot afford to hang on. The leading candidate to succeed him is Ludwig Erhard, the man who oversaw the post-war economic recovery and development of the country. Although Chancellor Adenauer has his misgivings about Erhard, the CDU is adamant and Erhard is set to take over as the second chancellor of West Germany"
 WGRPolitical.3.t:0 "Breakup of SDP and SDS"
 WGRPolitical.3.d:0 "The Social Democratic Party of West Germany (SDP) has formally announced its separation from the Socialist German Student Union (SDS). The SDS had formed shortly after the end of World War II as the college branch of the SDP. However, since independence it has continuously found itself at odds with the parent institution. Specifically, the SDS was strongly opposed to the rearming of West Germany which the SDP supported. In addition the SDS has expressed concern with the SDP working closely with mainstream parties  ideologically opposed to the SDP political tenants. The SDP has announced it will immediately expel all SDS members from its ranks. The SDS has announced it will act in the interest of the German people and workers and will not compromise its values for political gain or for foreign interests. More leftist members of the SDP are expected to switch loyalties."

 Elysee.1.t:0 "The Elysee Treaty"
 Elysee.1.d:0 "The President of France and Chancellor of West Germany today signed the Elysee Treaty in Paris. The treaty is meant to end decades of conflict and rivalry between the two continental European powers. The two states had been engaged in multiple armed conflicts from the nineteenth century to World War II. The treaty called for regular meetings between the two states. The heads of states are to regularly meet and an interministerial committee will coordinate cooperation between the two states. Both nations are to also coordinate defense and diplomatic cooperation amongst each other. The citizens of both countries welcome the treaty and eagerly await a new era of peace and cooperation between two of the most important land powers in Europe. The French government hopes this may lead to the establishment of a closer alliance to challenge Soviet and American hegemony, but time will tell if West Germany will share this long-term goal."
 Ostpolitik.3.d:0 "The West German government and Soviet Union recently concluded a new treaty called the Moscow Treaty. The two governments have agreed to normalize relations with one another. They also pledged keep international peace, renounce the use of arms, and agreed to the post-World War II borders. The treaty reflects the new policy of Ostpolitik being implemented by the current German government. By signing the treaty, West Germany has accepted its border with East Germany and for the moment is not pushing for German self-determination. More significantly, the government has accepted Poland controlling most of former East Prussia. Many in West Germany have expressed satisfaction with the reduction of tension but there is also discontent over the sacrifice of German borders and self-determination. The United States has expressed concern with this treaty."
 WGR_Pol.1.d:0 "Following World War II, the Allied powers agreed to give historical East Prussia to Poland. The Soviet Union implemented this ruling, ensuring East German acceptance. However, West Germany stated the post-war agreement was meant to be decided at a future date and the Polish occupation is unconfirmed. Today, the West German government reiterated its claims to East Prussia and stated German unification includes the restoration of East Prussia to the nation. The Soviet Union and Poland both called the statement provocative and an indication that West Germany harbors fascist territorial desires that threaten peace in Europe. The West German announcement has received support from many in the country but there is a large portion of the population who find the announcement to be far too provocative in the current political climate."
 RedArmyFaction.20.t:0 "The Stammheim Trial"
 RedArmyFaction.20.d:0 "The Red Army Faction (RAF) is a far-left militant organization conducting attacks across West Germany. The recent escalation in violence, kidnapping, and killings has led to a national crisis across West Germany. Many in Germany have grown suspicious that left leaning mainstream parties maybe ideologically connected to the militants. In this tense environment it has been decided to initiate a crackdown on the RAF. The security forces will more intensely work to arrest members and uproot the organization. Arrested RAF members will be detained in complete isolation from the media and not be allowed to make public statements. The intense isolation will also include banning members from meeting lawyers or family either. Although many Germans applaud the crackdown, there are many who fear suppressing RAF members rights reflects too much of the authoritarian past Germany has tried to put behind itself."
 Ostpolitik.4.d:0 "In Erfurt, the leaders of West Germany met for the first time with the leaders of East Germany. The meeting was said to be a success as both sides agreed to the need for greater communication and expressed a desire for de-escalation. It is expected from this summit that more interactions are to occur with the eventual goal being a normalization of relations between the two German nations. Although the summit is being hailed as key to achieving lasting peace and potential unification, many in the opposition in West Germany have expressed outrage. They argue the meeting legitimizes the East German regime and will only lead to a more permanent division of Germany. They call the summit a betrayal of the German people. Regardless, the summit appears to be a success of the West German effort at implementing Ostpolitik, a policy designed to ease tensions and normalize relations between West Germany and eastern Europe."
 WGR_Viet.1.d:0 "Today, the West German Republic announced that it would withdraw all ammunition supplies and support from the Vietnamese conflict in South-East Asia. Originally, supporting the democratic South Vietnam against the communists in the north, the Germans have stated that supporting such a war has weakened the German Republic both economically and militarily and should war come from the communist East German, they would be helpless. Many speculate that such a decision would hardly change the outcome of the Vietnamese conflict but it still has its effect on the relations between the two countries. "
 Spiegal_Affair.1.d:0 "The Spiegel Affair ended today with the resignation of Franz Strauss, the Minister of Defense. Several months ago, the newspaper Der Spiegel reported a senior NATO official characterized the West German military as incapable of defending the country. This prompted Strauss to send the police to occupy the newspaper, detain its staff, and he had the Spanish police arrest the author of the article in Madrid. He claimed the newspaper had revealed state secrets, but the public reacted by launching street protests against the heavy-handed approach of Strauss. Strauss ultimately failed to convince a court to try the newspaper and instead the court accused Strauss of exceeding his authority. Strauss chose to leave office to save the government and Der Spiegel was released from police occupation. Many in West Germany view this as a victory for democracy and free press."
 Europe_Space.1.d:0 "In West Germany, the European Space Operations Center became operational this week. The facility, located in Darmstadt, will act as the mission control for the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). The ESRO was founded by ten Western European states as a way to allow Europe to participate in the growing international space race. These states are combining their resources and expertise to propel Europe. From the new mission control, ESRO hopes to manage and coordinate future operations. Many in West Germany are proud they will be hosting this new facility and believe this reflects the importance Germans have had in advancing space research since its earliest days. Expectations are high that the European Space Operations Center will soon be launching missions into space at a sophistication equal to all other powers engaged in the space race."
