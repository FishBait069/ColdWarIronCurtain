 KPA_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The SM-45, or Siamese Mauser Type 45 rifle, is a bolt-action rifle developed by Koishikawa Arsenal in 1903. The rifle was initially developed as part of King Rama V's military development program which was started because he feared Western expansion in the East. The weapon itself is developed based off of the Gewehr 98 but with a few notable improvements to usability and ergonomics."

 KPA_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 58 is an assault rifle made in North Korea derived from the Soviet AK-47 designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov. This was the first weapon made in North Korea alongside the PPsh-41, made under license as the Type 49. After the Korean War, President Kim Il-sung ordered the fabrication of the Type 68. The assault rifle was first produced in 1958 and was made initially with Russian components until the North Koreans were able to make their own. While the Type 58 is based on the AK-47 with the milled receiver, the difference between the two assault rifles is that the former has identifying marks such as the five-point star in a circle and Type 58 in hangul. The quality of the rifle depends on the build, which usually ranges from average to poor."

 KPA_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Type 68 is a North Korean version of the AKM, it was adopted in 1968 to replace the Type 58. It is a gas operated, selective fire weapon chambered for a Soviet 7.62x39 mm intermediate cartridge. Internally the Type 68 is similar to the AK-47. The only difference is that the Type 68 has got no firing rate reduction mechanism. The baseline Type 68 has a solid wooden buttstock. Comparing with the previous Type 58 there was an improvement in how the buttock is connected to the receiver. There was also a Type 68-1 assault rifle with an under folding metal buttstock. The Type 68 comes with simple iron sights. Maximum sighting range is 800 meters, however range of effective fire is limited to 300-400 meters. Though the Type 68 is not as accurate as an improved Soviet AKM assault rifle."

 KPA_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Type 88 is a gas operated, selective fire weapon. Its design is similar to that of the AK-74. It is chambered for the same Soviet 5.45x39 mm ammunition. The Type 88 assault rifle is more accurate than the previous Type 68, chambered for a Soviet 7.62x39 mm round, however it is not as accurate as the US M16 or most other Western assault rifles. This assault rifle was adopted by the North Korean military and gradually replaces the previous Type 68 assault rifle, which is a copy of the AK-47. It has been exported to some African countries."

 KPA_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "An unusual dual-barrel infantry weapon with a distinctive appearance. It is modeled after a South Korean K11 assault rifle with integrated grenade launcher. The North Korean weapon integrates a modified Type 88-2 assault rifle (a derivative of a Soviet AK-74), which is entirely conventional in design. It is a gas-operated weapon, chambered for a standard Soviet 5.45x39 mm ammunition. This weapon is extremely reliable and will fire in worst conditions possible. The integrated grenade launcher is located over the rifle component. It fires 20 mm "smart" grenades. These programmable grenades are electronically set to explode for airburst at predefined ranges."
