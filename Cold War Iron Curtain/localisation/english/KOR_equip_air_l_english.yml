 KOR_utility_helicopter_equipment_4_desc:0 "First introduced in 1970, the UH-1N was another member of the extended 'Huey' family, this time being developed from the UH-1H, though unlike the UH-1A and UH-1D, the 'N' variant would be the one to spawn its civilian version, the Bell 212. The main rotor is powered by two turboshaft engines that drive a single output shaft. Should one engine fail the remaining engine can deliver 671 kW (900 shp) for 30 minutes or 571 kW (765 shp) enabling the UH-1N to maintain cruise performance at maximum weight. It was also one of the few 'Iroquois' variants not to be used by the U.S. Army, instead being the standard-bearer for the Marines. Its twin-engine configuration gave it the informal nickname 'Twin Huey.'"

 KOR_utility_helicopter_equipment_5_desc:0 "Entering service in 1979, the UH-60A was the successor to the UH-1 as the U.S. Army's utility helicopter platform. Developed from the civilian S-70, the UH-60A could carry up to 15 people (4 crew members and up to 11 equipped troops). Named after a Sauk Native American tribal leader, the 'Blackhawk' has served in combat during conflicts in Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Somalia, the Balkans, Afghanistan, and other areas in the Middle East."

 #KOR_cargo_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The CH-47 (originally HC-1B) is a twin-engine, tandem-rotor helicopter that is among the heaviest lifting helicopters of the West. Replacing the CH-37 Mojave, the CH-47 possesses several means of loading various cargo, including multiple doors across the fuselage, a wide loading ramp located at the rear of the fuselage, and a total of three external ventral cargo hooks to carry underslung loads. It was also the fastest helicopter among its contemporaries when introduced in 1962, and is still considered one of the fastest choppers in the U.S. Army's arsenal currently. Its name, 'Chinook', is from the Native American Chinook people of modern-day Washington state."

 KOR_cargo_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The CH-47D shares the same airframe as earlier models, the main difference being the adoption of more powerful engines. Early CH-47Ds were originally powered by two T55-L-712 engines, the most common engine is the later T55-GA-714A. With its triple-hook cargo system, the CH-47D can carry heavy payloads internally and up to 26,000 lb (12,000 kg) (such as 40-foot or 12-metre containers) externally. It was first introduced into service in 1979. In air assault operations, it often serves as the principal mover of the 155 mm M198 howitzer, accompanying 30 rounds of ammunition, and an 11-man crew."

 #KOR_cargo_helicopter_equipment_4_desc:0 "In October 1967, the US Marine Corps issued a requirement for a helicopter with a lifting capacity 1.8 times that of the CH-53D that would fit on amphibious warfare ships. The US Navy and US Army were also seeking similar helicopters at the time. Before issue of the requirement, Sikorsky had been working on an enhancement to the CH-53D, under the company designation "S-80", featuring a third turboshaft engine and a more powerful rotor system. Sikorsky proposed the S-80 design to the Marines in 1968. The Marines liked the idea, since it promised to deliver a good solution quickly, and funded development of a testbed helicopter for evaluation. The initial production contract was awarded in 1978, and service introduction followed in February 1981."

Upgrades include 4,868-shaft-horsepower (3,630 kW) Honeywell engines and the airframe featuring greater single-piece construction to lower maintenance requirements. The milled construction reduces vibration, as well as inspection and repair needs, and eliminates flexing points to increase service life."
